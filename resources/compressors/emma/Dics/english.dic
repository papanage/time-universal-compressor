ry solitary spot at that period and quite deserted after dark The tavern stood at some distance from any high road and was approachable only by a dark and narrow lane so that Hugh was much surprised to find several people drinking there and great merriment going on He was still more surprised to find among them almost every face that had caught his attention in the crowd but his companion having whispered him outside the door that it was not considered good manners at The Boot to appear at all curious about the company he kept his own counsel and made no show of recognition Before putting his lips to the liquor which was brought for them Dennis drank in a loud voice the health of Lord George Gordon President of the Great Protestant Association which toast Hugh pledged likewise with corresponding enthusiasm A fiddler who was present and who appeared to act as the appointed minstrel of the company forthwith struck up a Scotch reel and that in tones so invigorating that Hugh and his friend who had both been drinking before rose from their seats as by previous concert and to the great admiration of the assembled guests performed an extemporaneous No Popery Dance Chapter 39 The applause which the performance of Hugh and his new friend elicited from the company at The Boot had not yet subsided and the two dancers were still panting from their exertions which had been of a rather extreme and violent character when the party was reinforced by the arrival of some more guests who being a detachment of United Bulldogs were received with very flattering marks of distinction and respect The leader of this small party for including himself they were but three in number was our old acquaintance Mr Tappertit who seemed physically speaking to have grown smaller with years particularly as to his legs which were stupendously little but who in a moral point of view in personal dignity and self esteem had swelled into a giant Nor was it by any means difficult for the most unobservant person to detect this state of feeling in the quondam prentice for it not only proclaimed itself impressively and beyond mistake in his majestic walk and kindling eye but found a striking means of revelation in his turned up nose which scouted all things of earth with deep disdain and sought communion with its kindred skies Mr Tappertit as chief or captain of the Bulldogs was attended by his two lieutenants one the tall comrade of his younger life the other a Prentice Knight in days of yore Mark Gilbert bound in the olden time to Thomas Curzon of the Golden Fleece These gentlemen like himself were now emancipated from their prentice thraldom and served as journeymen but they were in humble emulation of his great example bold and daring spirits and aspired to a distinguished state in great political events Hence their connection with the Protestant Association of England sanctioned by the name of Lord George Gordon and hence their present visit to The Boot Gentlemen said Mr Tappertit taking off his hat as a great general might in addressing his troops Well met My lord does me and you the honour to send his compliments per self You ve seen my lord too have you said Dennis I see him this afternoon My duty called me to the Lobby when our shop shut up and I saw him there sir Mr Tappertit replied as he and his lieutenants took their seats How do YOU do Lively master lively said the fellow Here s a new brother regularly put down in black and white by Muster Gashford a credit to the cause one of the stick at nothing sort one arter my own heart D ye see him Has he got the looks of a man that ll do do you think he cried as he slapped Hugh on the back Looks or no looks said Hugh with a drunken flourish of his arm I m the man you want I hate the Papists every one of em They hate me and I hate them They do me all the harm they can and I ll do them all the harm I can Hurrah Was there ever said Dennis looking round the room when the echo of his boisterous voice bad died away was there ever such a game boy Why I mean to say brothers that if Muster Gashford had gone a hundred mile and got together fifty men of the common run they wouldn t have been worth this one The greater part of the company implicitly subscribed to this opinion and testified their faith in Hugh by nods and looks of great significance Mr Tappertit sat and contemplated him for a long time in silence as if he suspended his judgment then drew a little nearer to him and eyed him over more carefully then went close up to him and took him apart into a dark corner I say he began with a thoughtful brow haven t I seen you before It s like you may said Hugh in his careless way I don t know shouldn t wonder No but it s very easily settled returned Sim Look at me Did you ever see ME before You wouldn t be likely to forget it you know if you ever did Look at me Don t be afraid I won t do you any harm Take a good look steady now The encouraging way in which Mr Tappertit made this request and coupled it with an assurance that he needn t be frightened amused Hugh mightily so much indeed that be saw nothing at all of the small man before him through closing his eyes in a fit of hearty laughter which shook his great broad sides until they ached again Come said Mr Tappertit growing a little impatient under this disrespectful treatment Do you know me feller Not I cried Hugh Ha ha ha Not I But I should like to And yet I d have wagered a seven shilling piece said Mr Tappertit folding his arms and confronting him with his legs wide apart and firmly planted on the ground that you once were hostler at the Maypole Hugh opened his eyes on hearing this and looked at him in great surprise And so you were too said Mr Tappertit pushing him away with a condescending playfulness When did MY eyes ever deceive unless it was a young woman Don t you know me now Why it an t Hugh faltered An t it said Mr Tappertit Are you sure of that You remember G Varden don t you Certainly Hugh did and he remembered D Varden too but that he didn t tell him You remember coming down there before I was out of my time to ask after a vagabond that had bolted off and left his disconsolate father a prey to the bitterest emotions and all the rest of it don t you said Mr Tappertit Of course I do cried Hugh And I saw you there Saw me there said Mr Tappertit Yes I should think you did see me there The place would be troubled to go on without me Don t you remember my thinking you liked the vagabond and on that account going to quarrel with you and then finding you detested him worse than poison going to drink with you Don t you remember that To be sure cried Hugh Well and are you in the same mind now said Mr Tappertit Yes roared Hugh You speak like a man said Mr Tappertit and I ll shake hands with you With these conciliatory expressions he suited the action to the word and Hugh meeting his advances readily they performed the ceremony with a show of great heartiness I find said Mr Tappertit looking round on the assembled guests that brother What s his name and I are old acquaintance You never heard anything more of that rascal I suppose eh Not a syllable replied Hugh I never want to I don t believe I ever shall He s dead long ago I hope It s to be hoped for the sake of mankind in general and the happiness of society that he is said Mr Tappertit rubbing his palm upon his legs and looking at it between whiles Is your other hand at all cleaner Much the same Well I ll owe you another shake We ll suppose it done if you ve no objection Hugh laughed again and with such thorough abandonment to his mad humour that his limbs seemed dislocated and his whole frame in danger of tumbling to pieces but Mr Tappertit so far from receiving this extreme merriment with any irritation was pleased to regard it with the utmost favour and even to join in it so far as one of his gravity and station could with any regard to that decency and decorum which men in high places are expected to maintain Mr Tappertit did not stop here as many public characters might have done but calling up his brace of lieutenants introduced Hugh to them with high commendation declaring him to be a man who at such times as those in which they lived could not be too much cherished Further he did him the honour to remark that he would be an acquisition of which even the United Bulldogs might be proud and finding upon sounding him that he was quite ready and willing to enter the society for he was not at all particular and would have leagued himself that night with anything or anybody for any purpose whatsoever caused the necessary preliminaries to be gone into upon the spot This tribute to his great merit delighted no man more than Mr Dennis as he himself proclaimed with several rare and surprising oaths and indeed it gave unmingled satisfaction to the whole assembly Make anything you like of me cried Hugh flourishing the can he had emptied more than once Put me on any duty you please I m your man I ll do it Here s my captain here s my leader Ha ha ha Let him give me the word of command and I ll fight the whole Parliament House single handed or set a lighted torch to the King s Throne itself With that he smote Mr Tappertit on the back with such violence that his little body seemed to shrink into a mere nothing and roared again until the very foundlings near at hand were startled in their beds In fact a sense of something whimsical in their companionship seemed to have taken entire possession of his rude brain The bare fact of being patronised by a great man whom he could have crushed with one hand appeared in his eyes so eccentric and humorous that a kind of ferocious merriment gained the mastery over him and quite subdued his brutal nature He roared and roared again toasted Mr Tappertit a hundred times declared himself a Bulldog to the core and vowed to be faithful to him to the last drop of blood in his veins All these compliments Mr Tappertit received as matters of course flattering enough in their way but entirely attributable to his vast superiority His dignified self possession only delighted Hugh the more and in a word this giant and dwarf struck up a friendship which bade fair to be of long continuance as the one held it to be his right to command and the other considered it an exquisite pleasantry to obey Nor was Hugh by any means a passive follower who scrupled to act without precise and definite orders for when Mr Tappertit mounted on an empty cask which stood by way of rostrum in the room and volunteered a speech upon the alarming crisis then at hand he placed himself beside the orator and though he grinned from ear to ear at every word he said threw out such expressive hints to scoffers in the management of his cudgel that those who were at first the most disposed to interrupt became remarkably attentive and were the loudest in their approbation It was not all noise and jest however at The Boot nor were the whole party listeners to the speech There were some men at the other end of the room which was a long low roofed chamber in earnest conversation all the time and when any of this group went out fresh people were sure to come in soon afterwards and sit down in their places as though the others had relieved them on some watch or duty which it was pretty clear they did for these changes took place by the clock at intervals of half an hour These persons whispered very much among themselves and kept aloof and often looked round as jealous of their speech being overheard some two or three among them entered in books what seemed to be reports from the others when they were not thus employed one of them would turn to the newspapers which were strewn upon the table and from the St James s Chronicle the Herald Chronicle or Public Advertiser would read to the rest in a low voice some passage having reference to the topic in which they were all so deeply interested But the great attraction was a pamphlet called The Thunderer which espoused their own opinions and was supposed at that time to emanate directly from the Association This was always in request and whether read aloud to an eager knot of listeners or by some solitary man was certain to be followed by stormy talking and excited looks In the midst of all his merriment and admiration of his captain Hugh was made sensible by these and other tokens of the presence of an air of mystery akin to that which had so much impressed him out of doors It was impossible to discard a sense that something serious was going on and that under the noisy revel of the public house there lurked unseen and dangerous matter Little affected by this however he was perfectly satisfied with his quarters and would have remained there till morning but that his conductor rose soon after midnight to go home Mr Tappertit following his example left him no excuse to stay So they all three left the house together roaring a No Popery song until the fields resounded with the dismal noise Cheer up captain cried Hugh when they had roared themselves out of breath Another stave Mr Tappertit nothing loath began again and so the three went staggering on arm in arm shouting like madmen and defying the watch with great valour Indeed this did not require any unusual bravery or boldness as the watchmen of that time being selected for the office on account of excessive age and extraordinary infirmity had a custom of shutting themselves up tight in their boxes on the first symptoms of disturbance and remaining there until they disappeared In these proceedings Mr Dennis who had a gruff voice and lungs of considerable power distinguished himself very much and acquired great credit with his two companions What a queer fellow you are said Mr Tappertit You re so precious sly and close Why don t you ever tell what trade you re of Answer the captain instantly cried Hugh beating his hat down on his head why don t you ever tell what trade you re of I m of as gen teel a calling brother as any man in England as light a business as any gentleman could desire Was you prenticed to it asked Mr Tappertit No Natural genius said Mr Dennis No prenticing It come by natur Muster Gashford knows my calling Look at that hand of mine many and many a job that hand has done with a neatness and dex terity never known afore When I look at that hand said Mr Dennis shaking it in the air and remember the helegant bits of work it has turned off I feel quite molloncholy to think it should ever grow old and feeble But sich is life He heaved a deep sigh as he indulged in these reflections and putting his fingers with an absent air on Hugh s throat and particularly under his left ear as if he were studying the anatomical development of that part of his frame shook his head in a despondent manner and actually shed tears You re a kind of artist I suppose eh said Mr Tappertit Yes rejoined Dennis yes I may call myself a artist a fancy workman art improves natur that s my motto And what do you call this said Mr Tappertit taking his stick out of his hand That s my portrait atop Dennis replied d ye think it s like Why it s a little too handsome said Mr Tappertit Who did it You I repeated Dennis gazing fondly on his image I wish I had the talent That was carved by a friend of mine as is now no more The very day afore he died he cut that with his pocket knife from memory I ll die game says my friend and my last moments shall be dewoted to making Dennis s picter That s it That was a queer fancy wasn t it said Mr Tappertit It WAS a queer fancy rejoined the other breathing on his fictitious nose and polishing it with the cuff of his coat but he was a queer subject altogether a kind of gipsy one of the finest stand up men you ever see Ah He told me some things that would startle you a bit did that friend of mine on the morning when he died You were with him at the time were you said Mr Tappertit Yes he answered with a curious look I was there Oh yes certainly I was there He wouldn t have gone off half as comfortable without me I had been with three or four of his family under the same circumstances They were all fine fellows They must have been fond of you remarked Mr Tappertit looking at him sideways I don t know that they was exactly fond of me said Dennis with a little hesitation but they all had me near em when they departed I come in for their wardrobes too This very handkecher that you see round my neck belonged to him that I ve been speaking of him as did that likeness Mr Tappertit glanced at the article referred to and appeared to think that the deceased s ideas of dress were of a peculiar and by no means an expensive kind He made no remark upon the point however and suffered his mysterious companion to proceed without interruption These smalls said Dennis rubbing his legs these very smalls they belonged to a friend of mine that s left off sich incumbrances for ever this coat too I ve often walked behind this coat in the street and wondered whether it would ever come to me this pair of shoes have danced a hornpipe for another man afore my eyes full half a dozen times at least and as to my hat he said taking it off and whirling it round upon his fist Lord I ve seen this hat go up Holborn on the box of a hackney coach ah many and many a day You don t mean to say their old wearers are ALL dead I hope said Mr Tappertit falling a little distance from him as he spoke Every one of em replied Dennis Every man Jack There was something so very ghastly in this circumstance and it appeared to account in such a very strange and dismal manner for his faded dress which in this new aspect seemed discoloured by the earth from graves that Mr Tappertit abruptly found he was going another way and stopping short bade him good night with the utmost heartiness As they happened to be near the Old Bailey and Mr Dennis knew there were turnkeys in the lodge with whom he could pass the night and discuss professional subjects of common interest among them before a rousing fire and over a social glass he separated from his companions without any great regret and warmly shaking hands with Hugh and making an early appointment for their meeting at The Boot left them to pursue their road That s a strange sort of man said Mr Tappertit watching the hackney coachman s hat as it went bobbing down the street I don t know what to make of him Why can t he have his smalls made to order or wear live clothes at any rate He s a lucky man captain cried Hugh I should like to have such friends as his I hope he don t get em to make their wills and then knock em on the head said Mr Tappertit musing But come The United B s expect me On What s the matter I quite forgot said Hugh who had started at the striking of a neighbouring clock I have somebody to see to night I must turn back directly The drinking and singing put it out of my head It s well I remembered it Mr Tappertit looked at him as though he were about to give utterance to some very majestic sentiments in reference to this act of desertion but as it was clear from Hugh s hasty manner that the engagement was one of a pressing nature he graciously forbore and gave him his permission to depart immediately which Hugh acknowledged with a roar of laughter Good night captain he cried I am yours to the death remember Farewell said Mr Tappertit waving his hand Be bold and vigilant No Popery captain roared Hugh England in blood first cried his desperate leader Whereat Hugh cheered and laughed and ran off like a greyhound That man will prove a credit to my corps said Simon turning thoughtfully upon his heel And let me see In an altered state of society which must ensue if we break out and are victorious when the locksmith s child is mine Miggs must be got rid of somehow or she ll poison the tea kettle one evening when I m out He might marry Miggs if he was drunk enough It shall be done I ll make a note of it Chapter 40 Little thinking of the plan for his happy settlement in life which had suggested itself to the teeming brain of his provident commander Hugh made no pause until Saint Dunstan s giants struck the hour above him when he worked the handle of a pump which stood hard by with great vigour and thrusting his head under the spout let the water gush upon him until a little stream ran down from every uncombed hair and he was wet to the waist Considerably refreshed by this ablution both in mind and body and almost sobered for the time he dried himself as he best could then crossed the road and plied the knocker of the Middle Temple gate The night porter looked through a small grating in the portal with a surly eye and cried Halloa which greeting Hugh returned in kind and bade him open quickly We don t sell beer here cried the man what else do you want To come in Hugh replied with a kick at the door Where to go Paper Buildings Whose chambers Sir John Chester s Each of which answers he emphasised with another kick After a little growling on the other side the gate was opened and he passed in undergoing a close inspection from the porter as he did so YOU wanting Sir John at this time of night said the man Ay said Hugh I What of that Why I must go with you and see that you do for I don t believe it Come along then Eyeing him with suspicious looks the man with key and lantern walked on at his side and attended him to Sir John Chester s door at which Hugh gave one knock that echoed through the dark staircase like a ghostly summons and made the dull light tremble in the drowsy lamp Do you think he wants me now said Hugh Before the man had time to answer a footstep was heard within a light appeared and Sir John in his dressing gown and slippers opened the door I ask your pardon Sir John said the porter pulling off his hat Here s a young man says he wants to speak to you It s late for strangers I thought it best to see that all was right Aha cried Sir John raising his eyebrows It s you messenger is it Go in Quite right friend I commend your prudence highly Thank you God bless you Good night To be commended thanked God blessed and bade good night by one who carried Sir before his name and wrote himself M P to boot was something for a porter He withdrew with much humility and reverence Sir John followed his late visitor into the dressing room and sitting in his easy chair before the fire and moving it so that he could see him as he stood hat in hand beside the door looked at him from head to foot The old face calm and pleasant as ever the complexion quite juvenile in its bloom and clearness the same smile the wonted precision and elegance of dress the white well ordered teeth the delicate hands the composed and quiet manner everything as it used to be no mark of age or passion envy hate or discontent all unruffled and serene and quite delightful to behold He wrote himself M P but how Why thus It was a proud family more proud indeed than wealthy He had stood in danger of arrest of bailiffs and a jail a vulgar jail to which the common people with small incomes went Gentlemen of ancient houses have no privilege of exemption from such cruel laws unless they are of one great house and then they have A proud man of his stock and kindred had the means of sending him there He offered not indeed to pay his debts but to let him sit for a close borough until his own son came of age which if he lived would come to pass in twenty years It was quite as good as an Insolvent Act and infinitely more genteel So Sir John Chester was a member of Parliament But how Sir John Nothing so simple or so easy One touch with a sword of state and the transformation was effected John Chester Esquire M P attended court went up with an address headed a deputation Such elegance of manner so many graces of deportment such powers of conversation could never pass unnoticed Mr was too common for such merit A man so gentlemanly should have been but Fortune is capricious born a Duke just as some dukes should have been born labourers He caught the fancy of the king knelt down a grub and rose a butterfly John Chester Esquire was knighted and became Sir John I thought when you left me this evening my esteemed acquaintance said Sir John after a pretty long silence that you intended to return with all despatch So I did master And so you have he retorted glancing at his watch Is that what you would say Instead of replying Hugh changed the leg on which he leant shuffled his cap from one hand to the other looked at the ground the wall the ceiling and finally at Sir John himself before whose pleasant face he lowered his eyes again and fixed them on the floor And how have you been employing yourself in the meanwhile quoth Sir John lazily crossing his legs Where have you been what harm have you been doing No harm at all master growled Hugh with humility I have only done as you ordered As I WHAT returned Sir John Well then said Hugh uneasily as you advised or said I ought or said I might or said that you would do if you was me Don t be so hard upon me master Something like an expression of triumph in the perfect control he had established over this rough instrument appeared in the knight s face for an instant but it vanished directly as he said paring his nails while speaking When you say I ordered you my good fellow you imply that I directed you to do something for me something I wanted done something for my own ends and purposes you see Now I am sure I needn t enlarge upon the extreme absurdity of such an idea however unintentional so please and here he turned his eyes upon him to be more guarded Will you I meant to give you no offence said Hugh I don t know what to say You catch me up so very short You will be caught up much shorter my good friend infinitely shorter one of these days depend upon it replied his patron calmly By the bye instead of wondering why you have been so long my wonder should be why you came at all Why did you You know master said Hugh that I couldn t read the bill I found and that supposing it to be something particular from the way it was wrapped up I brought it here And could you ask no one else to read it Bruin said Sir John No one that I could trust with secrets master Since Barnaby Rudge was lost sight of for good and all and that s five years ago I haven t talked with any one but you You have done me honour I am sure I have come to and fro master all through that time when there was anything to tell because I knew that you d be angry with me if I stayed away said Hugh blurting the words out after an embarrassed silence and because I wished to please you if I could and not to have you go against me There That s the true reason why I came to night You know that master I am sure You are a specious fellow returned Sir John fixing his eyes upon him and carry two faces under your hood as well as the best Didn t you give me in this room this evening any other reason no dislike of anybody who has slighted you lately on all occasions abused you treated you with rudeness acted towards you more as if you were a mongrel dog than a man like himself To be sure I did cried Hugh his passion rising as the other meant it should and I say it all over now again I d do anything to have some revenge on him anything And when you told me that he and all the Catholics would suffer from those who joined together under that handbill I said I d make one of em if their master was the devil himself I AM one of em See whether I am as good as my word and turn out to be among the foremost or no I mayn t have much head master but I ve head enough to remember those that use me ill You shall see and so shall he and so shall hundreds more how my spirit backs me when the time comes My bark is nothing to my bite Some that I know had better have a wild lion among em than me when I am fairly loose they had The knight looked at him with a smile of far deeper meaning than ordinary and pointing to the old cupboard followed him with his eyes while he filled and drank a glass of liquor and smiled when his back was turned with deeper meaning yet You are in a blustering mood my friend he said when Hugh confronted him again Not I master cried Hugh I don t say half I mean I can t I haven t got the gift There are talkers enough among us I ll be one of the doers Oh you have joined those fellows then said Sir John with an air of most profound indifference Yes I went up to the house you told me of and got put down upon the muster There was another man there named Dennis Dennis eh cried Sir John laughing Ay ay a pleasant fellow I believe A roaring dog master one after my own heart hot upon the matter too red hot So I have heard replied Sir John carelessly You don t happen to know his trade do you He wouldn t say cried Hugh He keeps it secret Ha ha laughed Sir John A strange fancy a weakness with some persons you ll know it one day I dare swear We re intimate already said Hugh Quite natural And have been drinking together eh pursued Sir John Did you say what place you went to in company when you left Lord George s Hugh had not said or thought of saying but he told him and this inquiry being followed by a long train of questions he related all that had passed both in and out of doors the kind of people he had seen their numbers state of feeling mode of conversation apparent expectations and intentions His questioning was so artfully contrived that he seemed even in his own eyes to volunteer all this information rather than to have it wrested from him and he was brought to this state of feeling so naturally that when Mr Chester yawned at length and declared himself quite wearied out he made a rough kind of excuse for having talked so much There get you gone said Sir John holding the door open in his hand You have made a pretty evening s work I told you not to do this You may get into trouble You ll have an opportunity of revenging yourself on your proud friend Haredale though and for that you d hazard anything I suppose I would retorted Hugh stopping in his passage out and looking back but what do I risk What do I stand a chance of losing master Friends home A fig for em all I have none they are nothing to me Give me a good scuffle let me pay off old scores in a bold riot where there are men to stand by me and then use me as you like it don t matter much to me what the end is What have you done with that paper said Sir John I have it here master Drop it again as you go along it s as well not to keep such things about you Hugh nodded and touching his cap with an air of as much respect as he could summon up departed Sir John fastening the doors behind him went back to his dressing room and sat down once again before the fire at which he gazed for a long time in earnest meditation This happens fortunately he said breaking into a smile and promises well Let me see My relative and I who are the most Protestant fellows in the world give our worst wishes to the Roman Catholic cause and to Saville who introduces their bill I have a personal objection besides but as each of us has himself for the first article in his creed we cannot commit ourselves by joining with a very extravagant madman such as this Gordon most undoubtedly is Now really to foment his disturbances in secret through the medium of such a very apt instrument as my savage friend here may further our real ends and to express at all becoming seasons in moderate and polite terms a disapprobation of his proceedings though we agree with him in principle will certainly be to gain a character for honesty and uprightness of purpose which cannot fail to do us infinite service and to raise us into some importance Good So much for public grounds As to private considerations I confess that if these vagabonds WOULD make some riotous demonstration which does not appear impossible and WOULD inflict some little chastisement on Haredale as a not inactive man among his sect it would be extremely agreeable to my feelings and would amuse me beyond measure Good again Perhaps better When he came to this point he took a pinch of snuff then beginning slowly to undress he resumed his meditations by saying with a smile I fear I DO fear exceedingly that my friend is following fast in the footsteps of his mother His intimacy with Mr Dennis is very ominous But I have no doubt he must have come to that end any way If I lend him a helping hand the only difference is that he may upon the whole possibly drink a few gallons or puncheons or hogsheads less in this life than he otherwise would It s no business of mine It s a matter of very small importance So he took another pinch of snuff and went to bed Chapter 41 From the workshop of the Golden Key there issued forth a tinkling sound so merry and good humoured that it suggested the idea of some one working blithely and made quite pleasant music No man who hammered on at a dull monotonous duty could have brought such cheerful notes from steel and iron none but a chirping healthy honest hearted fellow who made the best of everything and felt kindly towards everybody could have done it for an instant He might have been a coppersmith and still been musical If he had sat in a jolting waggon full of rods of iron it seemed as if he would have brought some harmony out of it Tink tink tink clear as a silver bell and audible at every pause of the streets harsher noises as though it said I don t care nothing puts me out I am resolved to he happy Women scolded children squalled heavy carts went rumbling by horrible cries proceeded from the lungs of hawkers still it struck in again no higher no lower no louder no softer not thrusting itself on people s notice a bit the more for having been outdone by louder sounds tink tink tink tink tink It was a perfect embodiment of the still small voice free from all cold hoarseness huskiness or unhealthiness of any kind foot passengers slackened their pace and were disposed to linger near it neighbours who had got up splenetic that morning felt good humour stealing on them as they heard it and by degrees became quite sprightly mothers danced their babies to its ringing still the same magical tink tink tink came gaily from the workshop of the Golden Key Who but the locksmith could have made such music A gleam of sun shining through the unsashed window and chequering the dark workshop with a broad patch of light fell full upon him as though attracted by his sunny heart There he stood working at his anvil his face all radiant with exercise and gladness his sleeves turned up his wig pushed off his shining forehead the easiest freest happiest man in all the world Beside him sat a sleek cat purring and winking in the light and falling every now and then into an idle doze as from excess of comfort Toby looked on from a tall bench hard by one beaming smile from his broad nut brown face down to the slack baked buckles in his shoes The very locks that hung around had something jovial in their rust and seemed like gouty gentlemen of hearty natures disposed to joke on their infirmities There was nothing surly or severe in the whole scene It seemed impossible that any one of the innumerable keys could fit a churlish strong box or a prison door Cellars of beer and wine rooms where there were fires books gossip and cheering laughter these were their proper sphere of action Places of distrust and cruelty and restraint they would have left quadruple locked for ever Tink tink tink The locksmith paused at last and wiped his brow The silence roused the cat who jumping softly down crept to the door and watched with tiger eyes a bird cage in an opposite window Gabriel lifted Toby to his mouth and took a hearty draught Then as he stood upright with his head flung back and his portly chest thrown out you would have seen that Gabriel s lower man was clothed in military gear Glancing at the wall beyond there might have been espied hanging on their several pegs a cap and feather broadsword sash and coat of scarlet which any man learned in such matters would have known from their make and pattern to be the uniform of a serjeant in the Royal East London Volunteers As the locksmith put his mug down empty on the bench whence it had smiled on him before he glanced at these articles with a laughing eye and looking at them with his head a little on one side as though he would get them all into a focus said leaning on his hammer Time was now I remember when I was like to run mad with the desire to wear a coat of that colour If any one except my father had called me a fool for my pains how I should have fired and fumed But what a fool I must have been sure ly Ah sighed Mrs Varden who had entered unobserved A fool indeed A man at your time of life Varden should know better now Why what a ridiculous woman you are Martha said the locksmith turning round with a smile Certainly replied Mrs V with great demureness Of course I am I know that Varden Thank you I mean began the locksmith Yes said his wife I know what you mean You speak quite plain enough to be understood Varden It s very kind of you to adapt yourself to my capacity I am sure Tut tut Martha rejoined the locksmith don t take offence at nothing I mean how strange it is of you to run down volunteering when it s done to defend you and all the other women and our own fireside and everybody else s in case of need It s unchristian cried Mrs Varden shaking her head Unchristian said the locksmith Why what the devil Mrs Varden looked at the ceiling as in expectation that the consequence of this profanity would be the immediate descent of the four post bedstead on the second floor together with the best sitting room on the first but no visible judgment occurring she heaved a deep sigh and begged her husband in a tone of resignation to go on and by all means to blaspheme as much as possible because he knew she liked it The locksmith did for a moment seem disposed to gratify her but he gave a great gulp and mildly rejoined I was going to say what on earth do you call it unchristian for Which would be most unchristian Martha to sit quietly down and let our houses be sacked by a foreign army or to turn out like men and drive em off Shouldn t I be a nice sort of a Christian if I crept into a corner of my own chimney and looked on while a parcel of whiskered savages bore off Dolly or you When he said or you Mrs Varden despite herself relaxed into a smile There was something complimentary in the idea In such a state of things as that indeed she simpered As that repeated the locksmith Well that would be the state of things directly Even Miggs would go Some black tambourine player with a great turban on would be bearing HER off and unless the tambourine player was proof against kicking and scratching it s my belief he d have the worst of it Ha ha ha I d forgive the tambourine player I wouldn t have him interfered with on any account poor fellow And here the locksmith laughed again so heartily that tears came into his eyes much to Mrs Varden s indignation who thought the capture of so sound a Protestant and estimable a private character as Miggs by a pagan negro a circumstance too shocking and awful for contemplation The picture Gabriel had drawn indeed threatened serious consequences and would indubitably have led to them but luckily at that moment a light footstep crossed the threshold and Dolly running in threw her arms round her old father s neck and hugged him tight Here she is at last cried Gabriel And how well you look Doll and how late you are my darling How well she looked Well Why if he had exhausted every laudatory adjective in the dictionary it wouldn t have been praise enough When and where was there ever such a plump roguish comely bright eyed enticing bewitching captivating maddening little puss in all this world as Dolly What was the Dolly of five years ago to the Dolly of that day How many coachmakers saddlers cabinet makers and professors of other useful arts had deserted their fathers mothers sisters brothers and most of all their cousins for the love of her How many unknown gentlemen supposed to be of mighty fortunes if not titles had waited round the corner after dark and tempted Miggs the incorruptible with golden guineas to deliver offers of marriage folded up in love letters How many disconsolate fathers and substantial tradesmen had waited on the locksmith for the same purpose with dismal tales of how their sons had lost their appetites and taken to shut themselves up in dark bedrooms and wandering in desolate suburbs with pale faces and all because of Dolly Varden s loveliness and cruelty How many young men in all previous times of unprecedented steadiness had turned suddenly wild and wicked for the same reason and in an ecstasy of unrequited love taken to wrench off door knockers and invert the boxes of rheumatic watchmen How had she recruited the king s service both by sea and land through rendering desperate his loving subjects between the ages of eighteen and twenty five How many young ladies had publicly professed with tears in their eyes that for their tastes she was much too short too tall too bold too cold too stout too thin too fair too dark too everything but handsome How many old ladies taking counsel together had thanked Heaven their daughters were not like her and had hoped she might come to no harm and had thought she would come to no good and had wondered what people saw in her and had arrived at the conclusion that she was going off in her looks or had never come on in them and that she was a thorough imposition and a popular mistake And yet here was this same Dolly Varden so whimsical and hard to please that she was Dolly Varden still all smiles and dimples and pleasant looks and caring no more for the fifty or sixty young fellows who at that very moment were breaking their hearts to marry her than if so many oysters had been crossed in love and opened afterwards Dolly hugged her father as has been already stated and having hugged her mother also accompanied both into the little parlour where the cloth was already laid for dinner and where Miss Miggs a trifle more rigid and bony than of yore received her with a sort of hysterical gasp intended for a smile Into the hands of that young virgin she delivered her bonnet and walking dress all of a dreadful artful and designing kind and then said with a laugh which rivalled the locksmith s music How glad I always am to be at home again And how glad we always are Doll said her father putting back the dark hair from her sparkling eyes to have you at home Give me a kiss If there had been anybody of the male kind there to see her do it but there was not it was a mercy I don t like your being at the Warren said the locksmith I can t bear to have you out of my sight And what is the news over yonder Doll What news there is I think you know already replied his daughter I am sure you do though Ay cried the locksmith What s that Come come said Dolly you know very well I want you to tell me why Mr Haredale oh how gruff he is again to be sure has been away from home for some days past and why he is travelling about we know he IS travelling because of his letters without telling his own niece why or wherefore Miss Emma doesn t want to know I ll swear returned the locksmith I don t know that said Dolly but I do at any rate Do tell me Why is he so secret and what is this ghost story which nobody is to tell Miss Emma and which seems to be mixed up with his going away Now I see you know by your colouring so What the story means or is or has to do with it I know no more than you my dear returned the locksmith except that it s some foolish fear of little Solomon s which has indeed no meaning in it I suppose As to Mr Haredale s journey he goes as I believe Yes said Dolly As I believe resumed the locksmith pinching her cheek on business Doll What it may be is quite another matter Read Blue Beard and don t be too curious pet it s no business of yours or mine depend upon that and here s dinner which is much more to the purpose Dolly might have remonstrated against this summary dismissal of the subject notwithstanding the appearance of dinner but at the mention of Blue Beard Mrs Varden interposed protesting she could not find it in her conscience to sit tamely by and hear her child recommended to peruse the adventures of a Turk and Mussulman far less of a fabulous Turk which she considered that potentate to be She held that in such stirring and tremendous times as those in which they lived it would be much more to the purpose if Dolly became a regular subscriber to the Thunderer where she would have an opportunity of reading Lord George Gordon s speeches word for word which would be a greater comfort and solace to her than a hundred and fifty Blue Beards ever could impart She appealed in support of this proposition to Miss Miggs then in waiting who said that indeed the peace of mind she had derived from the perusal of that paper generally but especially of one article of the very last week as ever was entitled Great Britain drenched in gore exceeded all belief the same composition she added had also wrought such a comforting effect on the mind of a married sister of hers then resident at Golden Lion Court number twenty sivin second bell handle on the right hand door post that being in a delicate state of health and in fact expecting an addition to her family she had been seized with fits directly after its perusal and had raved of the Inquisition ever since to the great improvement of her husband and friends Miss Miggs went on to say that she would recommend all those whose hearts were hardened to hear Lord George themselves whom she commended first in respect of his steady Protestantism then of his oratory then of his eyes then of his nose then of his legs and lastly of his figure generally which she looked upon as fit for any statue prince or angel to which sentiment Mrs Varden fully subscribed Mrs Varden having cut in looked at a box upon the mantelshelf painted in imitation of a very red brick dwelling house with a yellow roof having at top a real chimney down which voluntary subscribers dropped their silver gold or pence into the parlour and on the door the counterfeit presentment of a brass plate whereon was legibly inscribed Protestant Association and looking at it said that it was to her a source of poignant misery to think that Varden never had of all his substance dropped anything into that temple save once in secret as she afterwards discovered two fragments of tobacco pipe which she hoped would not be put down to his last account That Dolly she was grieved to say was no less backward in her contributions better loving as it seemed to purchase ribbons and such gauds than to encourage the great cause then in such heavy tribulation and that she did entreat her her father she much feared could not be moved not to despise but imitate the bright example of Miss Miggs who flung her wages as it were into the very countenance of the Pope and bruised his features with her quarter s money Oh mim said Miggs don t relude to that I had no intentions mim that nobody should know Such sacrifices as I can make are quite a widder s mite It s all I have cried Miggs with a great burst of tears for with her they never came on by degrees but it s made up to me in other ways it s well made up This was quite true though not perhaps in the sense that Miggs intended As she never failed to keep her self denial full in Mrs Varden s view it drew forth so many gifts of caps and gowns and other articles of dress that upon the whole the red brick house was perhaps the best investment for her small capital she could possibly have hit upon returning her interest at the rate of seven or eight per cent in money and fifty at least in personal repute and credit You needn t cry Miggs said Mrs Varden herself in tears you needn t be ashamed of it though your poor mistress IS on the same side Miggs howled at this remark in a peculiarly dismal way and said she knowed that master hated her That it was a dreadful thing to live in families and have dislikes and not give satisfactions That to make divisions was a thing she could not abear to think of neither could her feelings let her do it That if it was master s wishes as she and him should part it was best they should part and she hoped he might be the happier for it and always wished him well and that he might find somebody as would meet his dispositions It would be a hard trial she said to part from such a missis but she could meet any suffering when her conscience told her she was in the rights and therefore she was willing even to go that lengths She did not think she added that she could long survive the separations but as she was hated and looked upon unpleasant perhaps her dying as soon as possible would be the best endings for all parties With this affecting conclusion Miss Miggs shed more tears and sobbed abundantly Can you bear this Varden said his wife in a solemn voice laying down her knife and fork Why not very well my dear rejoined the locksmith but I try to keep my temper Don t let there be words on my account mim sobbed Miggs It s much the best that we should part I wouldn t stay oh gracious me and make dissensions not for a annual gold mine and found in tea and sugar Lest the reader should be at any loss to discover the cause of Miss Miggs s deep emotion it may be whispered apart that happening to be listening as her custom sometimes was when Gabriel and his wife conversed together she had heard the locksmith s joke relative to the foreign black who played the tambourine and bursting with the spiteful feelings which the taunt awoke in her fair breast exploded in the manner we have witnessed Matters having now arrived at a crisis the locksmith as usual and for the sake of peace and quietness gave in What are you crying for girl he said What s the matter with you What are you talking about hatred for I don t hate you I don t hate anybody Dry your eyes and make yourself agreeable in Heaven s name and let us all be happy while we can The allied powers deeming it good generalship to consider this a sufficient apology on the part of the enemy and confession of having been in the wrong did dry their eyes and take it in good part Miss Miggs observed that she bore no malice no not to her greatest foe whom she rather loved the more indeed the greater persecution she sustained Mrs Varden approved of this meek and forgiving spirit in high terms and incidentally declared as a closing article of agreement that Dolly should accompany her to the Clerkenwell branch of the association that very night This was an extraordinary instance of her great prudence and policy having had this end in view from the first and entertaining a secret misgiving that the locksmith who was bold when Dolly was in question would object she had backed Miss Miggs up to this point in order that she might have him at a disadvantage The manoeuvre succeeded so well that Gabriel only made a wry face and with the warning he had just had fresh in his mind did not dare to say one word The difference ended therefore in Miggs being presented with a gown by Mrs Varden and half a crown by Dolly as if she had eminently distinguished herself in the paths of morality and goodness Mrs V according to custom expressed her hope that Varden would take a lesson from what had passed and learn more generous conduct for the time to come and the dinner being now cold and nobody s appetite very much improved by what had passed they went on with it as Mrs Varden said like Christians As there was to be a grand parade of the Royal East London Volunteers that afternoon the locksmith did no more work but sat down comfortably with his pipe in his mouth and his arm round his pretty daughter s waist looking lovingly on Mrs V from time to time and exhibiting from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot one smiling surface of good humour And to be sure when it was time to dress him in his regimentals and Dolly hanging about him in all kinds of graceful winning ways helped to button and buckle and brush him up and get him into one of the tightest coats that ever was made by mortal tailor he was the proudest father in all England What a handy jade it is said the locksmith to Mrs Varden who stood by with folded hands rather proud of her husband too while Miggs held his cap and sword at arm s length as if mistrusting that the latter might run some one through the body of its own accord but never marry a soldier Doll my dear Dolly didn t ask why not or say a word indeed but stooped her head down very low to tie his sash I never wear this dress said honest Gabriel but I think of poor Joe Willet I loved Joe he was always a favourite of mine Poor Joe Dear heart my girl don t tie me in so tight Dolly laughed not like herself at all the strangest little laugh that could be and held her head down lower still Poor Joe resumed the locksmith muttering to himself I always wish he had come to me I might have made it up between them if he had Ah old John made a great mistake in his way of acting by that lad a great mistake Have you nearly tied that sash my dear What an ill made sash it was There it was loose again and trailing on the ground Dolly was obliged to kneel down and recommence at the beginning Never mind young Willet Varden said his wife frowning you might find some one more deserving to talk about I think Miss Miggs gave a great sniff to the same effect Nay Martha cried the locksmith don t let us bear too hard upon him If the lad is dead indeed we ll deal kindly by his memory A runaway and a vagabond said Mrs Varden Miss Miggs expressed her concurrence as before A runaway my dear but not a vagabond returned the locksmith in a gentle tone He behaved himself well did Joe always and was a handsome manly fellow Don t call him a vagabond Martha Mrs Varden coughed and so did Miggs He tried hard to gain your good opinion Martha I can tell you said the locksmith smiling and stroking his chin Ah that he did It seems but yesterday that he followed me out to the Maypole door one night and begged me not to say how like a boy they used him say here at home he meant though at the time I recollect I didn t understand And how s Miss Dolly sir says Joe pursued the locksmith musing sorrowfully Ah Poor Joe Well I declare cried Miggs Oh Goodness gracious me What s the matter now said Gabriel turning sharply to her Why if here an t Miss Dolly said the handmaid stooping down to look into her face a giving way to floods of tears Oh mim oh sir Raly it s give me such a turn cried the susceptible damsel pressing her hand upon her side to quell the palpitation of her heart that you might knock me down with a feather The locksmith after glancing at Miss Miggs as if he could have wished to have a feather brought straightway looked on with a broad stare while Dolly hurried away followed by that sympathising young woman then turning to his wife stammered out Is Dolly ill Have I done anything Is it my fault Your fault cried Mrs V reproachfully There you had better make haste out What have I done said poor Gabriel It was agreed that Mr Edward s name was never to be mentioned and I have not spoken of him have I Mrs Varden merely replied that she had no patience with him and bounced off after the other two The unfortunate locksmith wound his sash about him girded on his sword put on his cap and walked out I am not much of a dab at my exercise he said under his breath but I shall get into fewer scrapes at that work than at this Every man came into the world for something my department seems to be to make every woman cry without meaning it It s rather hard But he forgot it before he reached the end of the street and went on with a shining face nodding to the neighbours and showering about his friendly greetings like mild spring rain Chapter 42 The Royal East London Volunteers made a brilliant sight that day formed into lines squares circles triangles and what not to the beating of drums and the streaming of flags and performed a vast number of complex evolutions in all of which Serjeant Varden bore a conspicuous share Having displayed their military prowess to the utmost in these warlike shows they marched in glittering order to the Chelsea Bun House and regaled in the adjacent taverns until dark Then at sound of drum they fell in again and returned amidst the shouting of His Majesty s lieges to the place from whence they came The homeward march being somewhat tardy owing to the un soldierlike behaviour of certain corporals who being gentlemen of sedentary pursuits in private life and excitable out of doors broke several windows with their bayonets and rendered it imperative on the commanding officer to deliver them over to a strong guard with whom they fought at intervals as they came along it was nine o clock when the locksmith reached home A hackney coach was waiting near his door and as he passed it Mr Haredale looked from the window and called him by his name The sight of you is good for sore eyes sir said the locksmith stepping up to him I wish you had walked in though rather than waited here There is nobody at home I find Mr Haredale answered besides I desired to be as private as I could Humph muttered the locksmith looking round at his house Gone with Simon Tappertit to that precious Branch no doubt Mr Haredale invited him to come into the coach and if he were not tired or anxious to go home to ride with him a little way that they might have some talk together Gabriel cheerfully complied and the coachman mounting his box drove off Varden said Mr Haredale after a minute s pause you will be amazed to hear what errand I am on it will seem a very strange one I have no doubt it s a reasonable one sir and has a meaning in it replied the locksmith or it would not be yours at all Have you just come back to town sir But half an hour ago Bringing no news of Barnaby or his mother said the locksmith dubiously Ah you needn t shake your head sir It was a wild goose chase I feared that from the first You exhausted all reasonable means of discovery when they went away To begin again after so long a time has passed is hopeless sir quite hopeless Why where are they he returned impatiently Where can they be Above ground God knows rejoined the locksmith many that I knew above it five years ago have their beds under the grass now And the world is a wide place It s a hopeless attempt sir believe me We must leave the discovery of this mystery like all others to time and accident and Heaven s pleasure Varden my good fellow said Mr Haredale I have a deeper meaning in my present anxiety to find them out than you can fathom It is not a mere whim it is not the casual revival of my old wishes and desires but an earnest solemn purpose My thoughts and dreams all tend to it and fix it in my mind I have no rest by day or night I have no peace or quiet I am haunted His voice was so altered from its usual tones and his manner bespoke so much emotion that Gabriel in his wonder could only sit and look towards him in the darkness and fancy the expression of his face Do not ask me continued Mr Haredale to explain myself If I were to do so you would think me the victim of some hideous fancy It is enough that this is so and that I cannot no I can not lie quietly in my bed without doing what will seem to you incomprehensible Since when sir said the locksmith after a pause has this uneasy feeling been upon you Mr Haredale hesitated for some moments and then replied Since the night of the storm In short since the last nineteenth of March As though he feared that Varden might express surprise or reason with him he hastily went on You will think I know I labour under some delusion Perhaps I do But it is not a morbid one it is a wholesome action of the mind reasoning on actual occurrences You know the furniture remains in Mrs Rudge s house and that it has been shut up by my orders since she went away save once a week or so when an old neighbour visits it to scare away the rats I am on my way there now For what purpose asked the locksmith To pass the night there he replied and not to night alone but many nights This is a secret which I trust to you in case of any unexpected emergency You will not come unless in case of strong necessity to me from dusk to broad day I shall be there Emma your daughter and the rest suppose me out of London as I have been until within this hour Do not undeceive them This is the errand I am bound upon I know I may confide it to you and I rely upon your questioning me no more at this time With that as if to change the theme he led the astounded locksmith back to the night of the Maypole highwayman to the robbery of Edward Chester to the reappearance of the man at Mrs Rudge s house and to all the strange circumstances which afterwards occurred He even asked him carelessly about the man s height his face his figure whether he was like any one he had ever seen like Hugh for instance or any man he had known at any time and put many questions of that sort which the locksmith considering them as mere devices to engage his attention and prevent his expressing the astonishment he felt answered pretty much at random At length they arrived at the corner of the street in which the house stood where Mr Haredale alighting dismissed the coach If you desire to see me safely lodged he said turning to the locksmith with a gloomy smile you can Gabriel to whom all former marvels had been nothing in comparison with this followed him along the narrow pavement in silence When they reached the door Mr Haredale softly opened it with a key he had about him and closing it when Varden entered they were left in thorough darkness They groped their way into the ground floor room Here Mr Haredale struck a light and kindled a pocket taper he had brought with him for the purpose It was then when the flame was full upon him that the locksmith saw for the first time how haggard pale and changed he looked how worn and thin he was how perfectly his whole appearance coincided with all that he had said so strangely as they rode along It was not an unnatural impulse in Gabriel after what he had heard to note curiously the expression of his eyes It was perfectly collected and rational so much so indeed that he felt ashamed of his momentary suspicion and drooped his own when Mr Haredale looked towards him as if he feared they would betray his thoughts Will you walk through the house said Mr Haredale with a glance towards the window the crazy shutters of which were closed and fastened Speak low There was a kind of awe about the place which would have rendered it difficult to speak in any other manner Gabriel whispered Yes and followed him upstairs Everything was just as they had seen it last There was a sense of closeness from the exclusion of fresh air and a gloom and heaviness around as though long imprisonment had made the very silence sad The homely hangings of the beds and windows had begun to droop the dust lay thick upon their dwindling folds and damps had made their way through ceiling wall and floor The boards creaked beneath their tread as if resenting the unaccustomed intrusion nimble spiders paralysed by the taper s glare checked the motion of their hundred legs upon the wall or dropped like lifeless things upon the ground the death watch ticked and the scampering feet of rats and mice rattled behind the wainscot As they looked about them on the decaying furniture it was strange to find how vividly it presented those to whom it had belonged and with whom it was once familiar Grip seemed to perch again upon his high backed chair Barnaby to crouch in his old favourite corner by the fire the mother to resume her usual seat and watch him as of old Even when they could separate these objects from the phantoms of the mind which they invoked the latter only glided out of sight but lingered near them still for then they seemed to lurk in closets and behind the doors ready to start out and suddenly accost them in well remembered tones They went downstairs and again into the room they had just now left Mr Haredale unbuckled his sword and laid it on the table with a pair of pocket pistols then told the locksmith he would light him to the door But this is a dull place sir said Gabriel lingering may no one share your watch He shook his head and so plainly evinced his wish to be alone that Gabriel could say no more In another moment the locksmith was standing in the street whence he could see that the light once more travelled upstairs and soon returning to the room below shone brightly through the chinks of the shutters If ever man were sorely puzzled and perplexed the locksmith was that night Even when snugly seated by his own fireside with Mrs Varden opposite in a nightcap and night jacket and Dolly beside him in a most distracting dishabille curling her hair and smiling as if she had never cried in all her life and never could even then with Toby at his elbow and his pipe in his mouth and Miggs but that perhaps was not much falling asleep in the background he could not quite discard his wonder and uneasiness So in his dreams still there was Mr Haredale haggard and careworn listening in the solitary house to every sound that stirred with the taper shining through the chinks until the day should turn it pale and end his lonely watching Chapter 43 Next morning brought no satisfaction to the locksmith s thoughts nor next day nor the next nor many others Often after nightfall he entered the street and turned his eyes towards the well known house and as surely as he did so there was the solitary light still gleaming through the crevices of the window shutter while all within was motionless noiseless cheerless as a grave Unwilling to hazard Mr Haredale s favour by disobeying his strict injunction he never ventured to knock at the door or to make his presence known in any way But whenever strong interest and curiosity attracted him to the spot which was not seldom the light was always there If he could have known what passed within the knowledge would have yielded him no clue to this mysterious vigil At twilight Mr Haredale shut himself up and at daybreak he came forth He never missed a night always came and went alone and never varied his proceedings in the least degree The manner of his watch was this At dusk he entered the house in the same way as when the locksmith bore him company kindled a light went through the rooms and narrowly examined them That done he returned to the chamber on the ground floor and laying his sword and pistols on the table sat by it until morning He usually had a book with him and often tried to read but never fixed his eyes or thoughts upon it for five minutes together The slightest noise without doors caught his ear a step upon the pavement seemed to make his heart leap He was not without some refreshment during the long lonely hours generally carrying in his pocket a sandwich of bread and meat and a small flask of wine The latter diluted with large quantities of water he drank in a heated feverish way as though his throat were dried but he scarcely ever broke his fast by so much as a crumb of bread If this voluntary sacrifice of sleep and comfort had its origin as the locksmith on consideration was disposed to think in any superstitious expectation of the fulfilment of a dream or vision connected with the event on which he had brooded for so many years and if he waited for some ghostly visitor who walked abroad when men lay sleeping in their beds he showed no trace of fear or wavering His stern features expressed inflexible resolution his brows were puckered and his lips compressed with deep and settled purpose and when he started at a noise and listened it was not with the start of fear but hope and catching up his sword as though the hour had come at last he would clutch it in his tight clenched hand and listen with sparkling eyes and eager looks until it died away These disappointments were numerous for they ensued on almost every sound but his constancy was not shaken Still every night he was at his post the same stern sleepless sentinel and still night passed and morning dawned and he must watch again This went on for weeks he had taken a lodging at Vauxhall in which to pass the day and rest himself and from this place when the tide served he usually came to London Bridge from Westminster by water in order that he might avoid the busy streets One evening shortly before twilight he came his accustomed road upon the river s bank intending to pass through Westminster Hall into Palace Yard and there take boat to London Bridge as usual There was a pretty large concourse of people assembled round the Houses of Parliament looking at the members as they entered and departed and giving vent to rather noisy demonstrations of approval or dislike according to their known opinions As he made his way among the throng he heard once or twice the No Popery cry which was then becoming pretty familiar to the ears of most men but holding it in very slight regard and observing that the idlers were of the lowest grade he neither thought nor cared about it but made his way along with perfect indifference There were many little knots and groups of persons in Westminster Hall some few looking upward at its noble ceiling and at the rays of evening light tinted by the setting sun which streamed in aslant through its small windows and growing dimmer by degrees were quenched in the gathering gloom below some noisy passengers mechanics going home from work and otherwise who hurried quickly through waking the echoes with their voices and soon darkening the small door in the distance as they passed into the street beyond some in busy conference together on political or private matters pacing slowly up and down with eyes that sought the ground and seeming by their attitudes to listen earnestly from head to foot Here a dozen squabbling urchins made a very Babel in the air there a solitary man half clerk half mendicant paced up and down with hungry dejection in his look and gait at his elbow passed an errand lad swinging his basket round and round and with his shrill whistle riving the very timbers of the roof while a more observant schoolboy half way through pocketed his ball and eyed the distant beadle as he came looming on It was that time of evening when if you shut your eyes and open them again the darkness of an hour appears to have gathered in a second The smooth worn pavement dusty with footsteps still called upon the lofty walls to reiterate the shuffle and the tread of feet unceasingly save when the closing of some heavy door resounded through the building like a clap of thunder and drowned all other noises in its rolling sound Mr Haredale glancing only at such of these groups as he passed nearest to and then in a manner betokening that his thoughts were elsewhere had nearly traversed the Hall when two persons before him caught his attention One of these a gentleman in elegant attire carried in his hand a cane which he twirled in a jaunty manner as he loitered on the other an obsequious crouching fawning figure listened to what he said at times throwing in a humble word himself and with his shoulders shrugged up to his ears rubbed his hands submissively or answered at intervals by an inclination of the head half way between a nod of acquiescence and a bow of most profound respect In the abstract there was nothing very remarkable in this pair for servility waiting on a handsome suit of clothes and a cane not to speak of gold and silver sticks or wands of office is common enough But there was that about the well dressed man yes and about the other likewise which struck Mr Haredale with no pleasant feeling He hesitated stopped and would have stepped aside and turned out of his path but at the moment the other two faced about quickly and stumbled upon him before he could avoid them The gentleman with the cane lifted his hat and had begun to tender an apology which Mr Haredale had begun as hastily to acknowledge and walk away when he stopped short and cried Haredale Gad bless me this is strange indeed It is he returned impatiently yes a My dear friend cried the other detaining him why such great speed One minute Haredale for the sake of old acquaintance I am in haste he said Neither of us has sought this meeting Let it be a brief one Good night Fie fie replied Sir John for it was he how very churlish We were speaking of you Your name was on my lips perhaps you heard me mention it No I am sorry for that I am really sorry You know our friend here Haredale This is really a most remarkable meeting The friend plainly very ill at ease had made bold to press Sir John s arm and to give him other significant hints that he was desirous of avoiding this introduction As it did not suit Sir John s purpose however that it should be evaded he appeared quite unconscious of these silent remonstrances and inclined his hand towards him as he spoke to call attention to him more particularly The friend therefore had nothing for it but to muster up the pleasantest smile he could and to make a conciliatory bow as Mr Haredale turned his eyes upon him Seeing that he was recognised he put out his hand in an awkward and embarrassed manner which was not mended by its contemptuous rejection Mr Gashford said Haredale coldly It is as I have heard then You have left the darkness for the light sir and hate those whose opinions you formerly held with all the bitterness of a renegade You are an honour sir to any cause I wish the one you espouse at present much joy of the acquisition it has made The secretary rubbed his hands and bowed as though he would disarm his adversary by humbling himself before him Sir John Chester again exclaimed with an air of great gaiety Now really this is a most remarkable meeting and took a pinch of snuff with his usual self possession Mr Haredale said Gashford stealthily raising his eyes and letting them drop again when they met the other s steady gaze is too conscientious too honourable too manly I am sure to attach unworthy motives to an honest change of opinions even though it implies a doubt of those he holds himself Mr Haredale is too just too generous too clear sighted in his moral vision to Yes sir he rejoined with a sarcastic smile finding the secretary stopped You were saying Gashford meekly shrugged his shoulders and looking on the ground again was silent No but let us really interposed Sir John at this juncture let us really for a moment contemplate the very remarkable character of this meeting Haredale my dear friend pardon me if I think you are not sufficiently impressed with its singularity Here we stand by no previous appointment or arrangement three old schoolfellows in Westminster Hall three old boarders in a remarkably dull and shady seminary at Saint Omer s where you being Catholics and of necessity educated out of England were brought up and where I being a promising young Protestant at that time was sent to learn the French tongue from a native of Paris Add to the singularity Sir John said Mr Haredale that some of you Protestants of promise are at this moment leagued in yonder building to prevent our having the surpassing and unheard of privilege of teaching our children to read and write here in this land where thousands of us enter your service every year and to preserve the freedom of which we die in bloody battles abroad in heaps and that others of you to the number of some thousands as I learn are led on to look on all men of my creed as wolves and beasts of prey by this man Gashford Add to it besides the bare fact that this man lives in society walks the streets in broad day I was about to say holds up his head but that he does not and it will be strange and very strange I grant you Oh you are hard upon our friend replied Sir John with an engaging smile You are really very hard upon our friend Let him go on Sir John said Gashford fumbling with his gloves Let him go on I can make allowances Sir John I am honoured with your good opinion and I can dispense with Mr Haredale s Mr Haredale is a sufferer from the penal laws and I can t expect his favour You have so much of my favour sir retorted Mr Haredale with a bitter glance at the third party in their conversation that I am glad to see you in such good company You are the essence of your great Association in yourselves Now there you mistake said Sir John in his most benignant way There which is a most remarkable circumstance for a man of your punctuality and exactness Haredale you fall into error I don t belong to the body I have an immense respect for its members but I don t belong to it although I am it is certainly true the conscientious opponent of your being relieved I feel it my duty to be so it is a most unfortunate necessity and cost me a bitter struggle Will you try this box If you don t object to a trifling infusion of a very chaste scent you ll find its flavour exquisite I ask your pardon Sir John said Mr Haredale declining the proffer with a motion of his hand for having ranked you among the humble instruments who are obvious and in all men s sight I should have done more justice to your genius Men of your capacity plot in secrecy and safety and leave exposed posts to the duller wits Don t apologise for the world replied Sir John sweetly old friends like you and I may be allowed some freedoms or the deuce is in it Gashford who had been very restless all this time but had not once looked up now turned to Sir John and ventured to mutter something to the effect that he must go or my lord would perhaps be waiting Don t distress yourself good sir said Mr Haredale I ll take my leave and put you at your ease which he was about to do without ceremony when he was stayed by a buzz and murmur at the upper end of the hall and looking in that direction saw Lord George Gordon coming in with a crowd of people round him There was a lurking look of triumph though very differently expressed in the faces of his two companions which made it a natural impulse on Mr Haredale s part not to give way before this leader but to stand there while he passed He drew himself up and clasping his hands behind him looked on with a proud and scornful aspect while Lord George slowly advanced for the press was great about him towards the spot where they were standing He had left the House of Commons but that moment and had come straight down into the Hall bringing with him as his custom was intelligence of what had been said that night in reference to the Papists and what petitions had been presented in their favour and who had supported them and when the bill was to be brought in and when it would be advisable to present their own Great Protestant petition All this he told the persons about him in a loud voice and with great abundance of ungainly gesture Those who were nearest him made comments to each other and vented threats and murmurings those who were outside the crowd cried Silence and Stand back or closed in upon the rest endeavouring to make a forcible exchange of places and so they came driving on in a very disorderly and irregular way as it is the manner of a crowd to do When they were very near to where the secretary Sir John and Mr Haredale stood Lord George turned round and making a few remarks of a sufliciently violent and incoherent kind concluded with the usual sentiment and called for three cheers to back it While these were in the act of being given with great energy he extricated himself from the press and stepped up to Gashford s side Both he and Sir John being well known to the populace they fell back a little and left the four standing together Mr Haredale Lord George said Sir John Chester seeing that the nobleman regarded him with an inquisitive look A Catholic gentleman unfortunately most unhappily a Catholic but an esteemed acquaintance of mine and once of Mr Gashford s My dear Haredale this is Lord George Gordon I should have known that had I been ignorant of his lordship s person said Mr Haredale I hope there is but one gentleman in England who addressing an ignorant and excited throng would speak of a large body of his fellow subjects in such injurious language as I heard this moment For shame my lord for shame I cannot talk to you sir replied Lord George in a loud voice and waving his hand in a disturbed and agitated manner we have nothing in common We have much in common many things all that the Almighty gave us said Mr Haredale and common charity not to say common sense and common decency should teach you to refrain from these proceedings If every one of those men had arms in their hands at this moment as they have them in their heads I would not leave this place without telling you that you disgrace your station I don t hear you sir he replied in the same manner as before I can t hear you It is indifferent to me what you say Don t retort Gashford for the secretary had made a show of wishing to do so I can hold no communion with the worshippers of idols As he said this he glanced at Sir John who lifted his hands and eyebrows as if deploring the intemperate conduct of Mr Haredale and smiled in admiration of the crowd and of their leader HE retort cried Haredale Look you here my lord Do you know this man Lord George replied by laying his hand upon the shoulder of his cringing secretary and viewing him with a smile of confidence This man said Mr Haredale eyeing him from top to toe who in his boyhood was a thief and has been from that time to this a servile false and truckling knave this man who has crawled and crept through life wounding the hands he licked and biting those he fawned upon this sycophant who never knew what honour truth or courage meant who robbed his benefactor s daughter of her virtue and married her to break her heart and did it with stripes and cruelty this creature who has whined at kitchen windows for the broken food and begged for halfpence at our chapel doors this apostle of the faith whose tender conscience cannot bear the altars where his vicious life was publicly denounced Do you know this man Oh really you are very very hard upon our friend exclaimed Sir John Let Mr Haredale go on said Gashford upon whose unwholesome face the perspiration had broken out during this speech in blotches of wet I don t mind him Sir John it s quite as indifferent to me what he says as it is to my lord If he reviles my lord as you have heard Sir John how can I hope to escape Is it not enough my lord Mr Haredale continued that I as good a gentleman as you must hold my property such as it is by a trick at which the state connives because of these hard laws and that we may not teach our youth in schools the common principles of right and wrong but must we be denounced and ridden by such men as this Here is a man to head your No Popery cry For shame For shame The infatuated nobleman had glanced more than once at Sir John Chester as if to inquire whether there was any truth in these statements concerning Gashford and Sir John had as often plainly answered by a shrug or look Oh dear me no He now said in the same loud key and in the same strange manner as before I have nothing to say sir in reply and no desire to hear anything more I beg you won t obtrude your conversation or these personal attacks upon me I shall not be deterred from doing my duty to my country and my countrymen by any such attempts whether they proceed from emissaries of the Pope or not I assure you Come Gashford They had walked on a few paces while speaking and were now at the Hall door through which they passed together Mr Haredale without any leave taking turned away to the river stairs which were close at hand and hailed the only boatman who remained there But the throng of people the foremost of whom had heard every word that Lord George Gordon said and among all of whom the rumour had been rapidly dispersed that the stranger was a Papist who was bearding him for his advocacy of the popular cause came pouring out pell mell and forcing the nobleman his secretary and Sir John Chester on before them so that they appeared to be at their head crowded to the top of the stairs where Mr Haredale waited until the boat was ready and there stood still leaving him on a little clear space by himself They were not silent however though inactive At first some indistinct mutterings arose among them which were followed by a hiss or two and these swelled by degrees into a perfect storm Then one voice said Down with the Papists and there was a pretty general cheer but nothing more After a lull of a few moments one man cried out Stone him another Duck him another in a stentorian voice No Popery This favourite cry the rest re echoed and the mob which might have been two hundred strong joined in a general shout Mr Haredale had stood calmly on the brink of the steps until they made this demonstration when he looked round contemptuously and walked at a slow pace down the stairs He was pretty near the boat when Gashford as if without intention turned about and directly afterwards a great stone was thrown by some hand in the crowd which struck him on the head and made him stagger like a drunken man The blood sprung freely from the wound and trickled down his coat He turned directly and rushing up the steps with a boldness and passion which made them all fall back demanded Who did that Show me the man who hit me Not a soul moved except some in the rear who slunk off and escaping to the other side of the way looked on like indifferent spectators Who did that he repeated Show me the man who did it Dog was it you It was your deed if not your hand I know you He threw himself on Gashford as he said the words and hurled him to the ground There was a sudden motion in the crowd and some laid hands upon him but his sword was out and they fell off again My lord Sir John he cried draw one of you you are responsible for this outrage and I look to you Draw if you are gentlemen With that he struck Sir John upon the breast with the flat of his weapon and with a burning face and flashing eyes stood upon his guard alone before them all For an instant for the briefest space of time the mind can readily conceive there was a change in Sir John s smooth face such as no man ever saw there The next moment he stepped forward and laid one hand on Mr Haredale s arm while with the other he endeavoured to appease the crowd My dear friend my good Haredale you are blinded with passion it s very natural extremely natural but you don t know friends from foes I know them all sir I can distinguish well he retorted almost mad with rage Sir John Lord George do you hear me Are you cowards Never mind sir said a man forcing his way between and pushing him towards the stairs with friendly violence never mind asking that For God s sake get away What CAN you do against this number And there are as many more in the next street who ll be round dfrectly indeed they began to pour in as he said the words you d be giddy from that cut in the first heat of a scuffle Now do retire sir or take my word for it you ll be worse used than you would be if every man in the crowd was a woman and that woman Bloody Mary Come sir make haste as quick as you can Mr Haredale who began to turn faint and sick felt how sensible this advice was and descended the steps with his unknown friend s assistance John Grueby for John it was helped him into the boat and giving her a shove off which sent her thirty feet into the tide bade the waterman pull away like a Briton and walked up again as composedly as if he had just landed There was at first a slight disposition on the part of the mob to resent this interference but John looking particularly strong and cool and wearing besides Lord George s livery they thought better of it and contented themselves with sending a shower of small missiles after the boat which plashed harmlessly in the water for she had by this time cleared the bridge and was darting swiftly down the centre of the stream From this amusement they proceeded to giving Protestant knocks at the doors of private houses breaking a few lamps and assaulting some stray constables But it being whispered that a detachment of Life Guards had been sent for they took to their heels with great expedition and left the street quite clear Chapter 44 When the concourse separated and dividing into chance clusters drew off in various directions there still remained upon the scene of the late disturbance one man This man was Gashford who bruised by his late fall and hurt in a much greater degree by the indignity he had undergone and the exposure of which he had been the victim limped up and down breathing curses and threats of vengeance It was not the secretary s nature to waste his wrath in words While he vented the froth of his malevolence in those effusions he kept a steady eye on two men who having disappeared with the rest when the alarm was spread had since returned and were now visible in the moonlight at no great distance as they walked to and fro and talked together He made no move towards them but waited patiently on the dark side of the street until they were tired of strolling backwards and forwards and walked away in company Then he followed but at some distance keeping them in view without appearing to have that object or being seen by them They went up Parliament Street past Saint Martin s church and away by Saint Giles s to Tottenham Court Road at the back of which upon the western side was then a place called the Green Lanes This was a retired spot not of the choicest kind leading into the fields Great heaps of ashes stagnant pools overgrown with rank grass and duckweed broken turnstiles and the upright posts of palings long since carried off for firewood which menaced all heedless walkers with their jagged and rusty nails were the leading features of the landscape while here and there a donkey or a ragged horse tethered to a stake and cropping off a wretched meal from the coarse stunted turf were quite in keeping with the scene and would have suggested if the houses had not done so sufficiently of themselves how very poor the people were who lived in the crazy huts adjacent and how foolhardy it might prove for one who carried money or wore decent clothes to walk that way alone unless by daylight Poverty has its whims and shows of taste as wealth has Some of these cabins were turreted some had false windows painted on their rotten walls one had a mimic clock upon a crazy tower of four feet high which screened the chimney each in its little patch of ground had a rude seat or arbour The population dealt in bones in rags in broken glass in old wheels in birds and dogs These in their several ways of stowage filled the gardens and shedding a perfume not of the most delicious nature in the air filled it besides with yelps and screams and howling Into this retreat the secretary followed the two men whom he had held in sight and here he saw them safely lodged in one of the meanest houses which was but a room and that of small dimensions He waited without until the sound of their voices joined in a discordant song assured him they were making merry and then approaching the door by means of a tottering plank which crossed the ditch in front knocked at it with his hand Muster Gashfordl said the man who opened it taking his pipe from his mouth in evident surprise Why who d have thought of this here honour Walk in Muster Gashford walk in sir Gashford required no second invitation and entered with a gracious air There was a fire in the rusty grate for though the spring was pretty far advanced the nights were cold and on a stool beside it Hugh sat smoking Dennis placed a chair his only one for the secretary in front of the hearth and took his seat again upon the stool he had left when he rose to give the visitor admission What s in the wind now Muster Gashford he said as he resumed his pipe and looked at him askew Any orders from head quarters Are we going to begin What is it Muster Gashford Oh nothing nothing rejoined the secretary with a friendly nod to Hugh We have broken the ice though We had a little spurt to day eh Dennis A very little one growled the hangman Not half enough for me Nor me neither cried Hugh Give us something to do with life in it with life in it master Ha ha Why you wouldn t said the secretary with his worst expression of face and in his mildest tones have anything to do with with death in it I don t know that replied Hugh I m open to orders I don t care not I Nor I vociferated Dennis Brave fellows said the secretary in as pastor like a voice as if he were commending them for some uncommon act of valour and generosity By the bye and here he stopped and warmed his hands then suddenly looked up who threw that stone to day Mr Dennis coughed and shook his head as who should say A mystery indeed Hugh sat and smoked in silence It was well done said the secretary warming his hands again I should like to know that man Would you said Dennis after looking at his face to assure himself that he was serious Would you like to know that man Muster Gashford I should indeed replied the secretary Why then Lord love you said the hangman in his hoarest chuckle as he pointed with his pipe to Hugh there he sits That s the man My stars and halters Muster Gashford he added in a whisper as he drew his stool close to him and jogged him with his elbow what a interesting blade he is He wants as much holding in as a thorough bred bulldog If it hadn t been for me to day he d have had that ere Roman down and made a riot of it in another minute And why not cried Hugh in a surly voice as he overheard this last remark Where s the good of putting things off Strike while the iron s hot that s what I say Ah retorted Dennis shaking his head with a kind of pity for his friend s ingenuous youth but suppose the iron an t hot brother You must get people s blood up afore you strike and have em in the humour There wasn t quite enough to provoke em to day I tell you If you d had your way you d have spoilt the fun to come and ruined us Dennis is quite right said Gashford smoothly He is perfectly correct Dennis has great knowledge of the world I ought to have Muster Gashford seeing what a many people I ve helped out of it eh grinned the hangman whispering the words behind his hand The secretary laughed at this jest as much as Dennis could desire and when he had done said turning to Hugh Dennis s policy was mine as you may have observed You saw for instance how I fell when I was set upon I made no resistance I did nothing to provoke an outbreak Oh dear no No by the Lord Harry cried Dennis with a noisy laugh you went down very quiet Muster Gashford and very flat besides I thinks to myself at the time it s all up with Muster Gashford I never see a man lay flatter nor more still with the life in him than you did to day He s a rough un to play with is that ere Papist and that s the fact The secretary s face as Dennis roared with laughter and turned his wrinkled eyes on Hugh who did the like might have furnished a study for the devil s picture He sat quite silent until they were serious again and then said looking round We are very pleasant here so very pleasant Dennis that but for my lord s particular desire that I should sup with him and the time being very near at hand I should he inclined to stay until it would be hardly safe to go homeward I come upon a little business yes I do as you supposed It s very flattering to you being this If we ever should be obliged and we can t tell you know this is a very uncertain world I believe you Muster Gashford interposed the hangman with a grave nod The uncertainties as I ve seen in reference to this here state of existence the unexpected contingencies as have come about Oh my eye Feeling the subject much too vast for expression he puffed at his pipe again and looked the rest I say resumed the secretary in a slow impressive way we can t tell what may come to pass and if we should be obliged against our wills to have recourse to violence my lord who has suffered terribly to day as far as words can go consigns to you two bearing in mind my recommendation of you both as good staunch men beyond all doubt and suspicion the pleasant task of punishing this Haredale You may do as you please with him or his provided that you show no mercy and no quarter and leave no two beams of his house standing where the builder placed them You may sack it burn it do with it as you like but it must come down it must be razed to the ground and he and all belonging to him left as shelterless as new born infants whom their mothers have exposed Do you understand me said Gashford pausing and pressing his hands together gently Understand you master cried Hugh You speak plain now Why this is hearty I knew you would like it said Gashford shaking him by the hand I thought you would Good night Don t rise Dennis I would rather find my way alone I may have to make other visits here and it s pleasant to come and go without disturbing you I can find my way perfectly well Good night He was gone and had shut the door behind him They looked at each other and nodded approvingly Dennis stirred up the fire This looks a little more like business he said Ay indeed cried Hugh this suits me I ve heerd it said of Muster Gashford said the hangman that he d a surprising memory and wonderful firmness that he never forgot and never forgave Let s drink his health Hugh readily complied pouring no liquor on the floor when he drank this toast and they pledged the secretary as a man after their own hearts in a bumper Chapter 45 While the worst passions of the worst men were thus working in the dark and the mantle of religion assumed to cover the ugliest deformities threatened to become the shroud of all that was good and peaceful in society a circumstance occurred which once more altered the position of two persons from whom this history has long been separated and to whom it must now return In a small English country town the inhabitants of which supported themselves by the labour of their hands in plaiting and preparing straw for those who made bonnets and other articles of dress and ornament from that material concealed under an assumed name and living in a quiet poverty which knew no change no pleasures and few cares but that of struggling on from day to day in one great toil for bread dwelt Barnaby and his mother Their poor cottage had known no stranger s foot since they sought the shelter of its roof five years before nor had they in all that time held any commerce or communication with the old world from which they had fled To labour in peace and devote her labour and her life to her poor son was all the widow sought If happiness can be said at any time to be the lot of one on whom a secret sorrow preys she was happy now Tranquillity resignation and her strong love of him who needed it so much formed the small circle of her quiet joys and while that remained unbroken she was contented For Barnaby himself the time which had flown by had passed him like the wind The daily suns of years had shed no brighter gleam of reason on his mind no dawn had broken on his long dark night He would sit sometimes often for days together on a low seat by the fire or by the cottage door busy at work for he had learnt the art his mother plied and listening God help him to the tales she would repeat as a lure to keep him in her sight He had no recollection of these little narratives the tale of yesterday was new to him upon the morrow but he liked them at the moment and when the humour held him would remain patiently within doors hearing her stories like a little child and working cheerfully from sunrise until it was too dark to see At other times and then their scanty earnings were barely sufficient to furnish them with food though of the coarsest sort he would wander abroad from dawn of day until the twilight deepened into night Few in that place even of the children could be idle and he had no companions of his own kind Indeed there were not many who could have kept up with him in his rambles had there been a legion But there were a score of vagabond dogs belonging to the neighbours who served his purpose quite as well With two or three of these or sometimes with a full half dozen barking at his heels he would sally forth on some long expedition that consumed the day and though on their return at nightfall the dogs would come home limping and sore footed and almost spent with their fatigue Barnaby was up and off again at sunrise with some new attendants of the same class with whom he would return in like manner On all these travels Grip in his little basket at his master s back was a constant member of the party and when they set off in fine weather and in high spirits no dog barked louder than the raven Their pleasures on these excursions were simple enough A crust of bread and scrap of meat with water from the brook or spring sufficed for their repast Barnaby s enjoyments were to walk and run and leap till he was tired then to lie down in the long grass or by the growing corn or in the shade of some tall tree looking upward at the light clouds as they floated over the blue surface of the sky and listening to the lark as she poured out her brilliant song There were wild flowers to pluck the bright red poppy the gentle harebell the cowslip and the rose There were birds to watch fish ants worms hares or rabbits as they darted across the distant pathway in the wood and so were gone millions of living things to have an interest in and lie in wait for and clap hands and shout in memory of when they had disappeared In default of these or when they wearied there was the merry sunlight to hunt out as it crept in aslant through leaves and boughs of trees and hid far down deep deep in hollow places like a silver pool where nodding branches seemed to bathe and sport sweet scents of summer air breathing over fields of beans or clover the perfume of wet leaves or moss the life of waving trees and shadows always changing When these or any of them tired or in excess of pleasing tempted him to shut his eyes there was slumber in the midst of all these soft delights with the gentle wind murmuring like music in his ears and everything around melting into one delicious dream Their hut for it was little more stood on the outskirts of the town at a short distance from the high road but in a secluded place where few chance passengers strayed at any season of the year It had a plot of garden ground attached which Barnaby in fits and starts of working trimmed and kept in order Within doors and without his mother laboured for their common good and hail rain snow or sunshine found no difference in her Though so far removed from the scenes of her past life and with so little thought or hope of ever visiting them again she seemed to have a strange desire to know what happened in the busy world Any old newspaper or scrap of intelligence from London she caught at with avidity The excitement it produced was not of a pleasurable kind for her manner at such times expressed the keenest anxiety and dread but it never faded in the least degree Then and in stormy winter nights when the wind blew loud and strong the old expression came into her face and she would be seized with a fit of trembling like one who had an ague But Barnaby noted little of this and putting a great constraint upon herself she usually recovered her accustomed manner before the change had caught his observation Grip was by no means an idle or unprofitable member of the humble household Partly by dint of Barnaby s tuition and partly by pursuing a species of self instruction common to his tribe and exerting his powers of observation to the utmost he had acquired a degree of sagacity which rendered him famous for miles round His conversational powers and surprising performances were the universal theme and as many persons came to see the wonderful raven and none left his exertions unrewarded when he condescended to exhibit which was not always for genius is capricious his earnings formed an important item in the common stock Indeed the bird himself appeared to know his value well for though he was perfectly free and unrestrained in the presence of Barnaby and his mother he maintained in public an amazing gravity and never stooped to any other gratuitous performances than biting the ankles of vagabond boys an exercise in which he much delighted killing a fowl or two occasionally and swallowing the dinners of various neighbouring dogs of whom the boldest held him in great awe and dread Time had glided on in this way and nothing had happened to disturb or change their mode of life when one summer s night in June they were in their little garden resting from the labours of the day The widow s work was yet upon her knee and strewn upon the ground about her and Barnaby stood leaning on his spade gazing at the brightness in the west and singing softly to himself A brave evening mother If we had chinking in our pockets but a few specks of that gold which is piled up yonder in the sky we should be rich for life We are better as we are returned the widow with a quiet smile Let us be contented and we do not want and need not care to have it though it lay shining at our feet Ay said Barnaby resting with crossed arms on his spade and looking wistfully at the sunset that s well enough mother but gold s a good thing to have I wish that I knew where to find it Grip and I could do much with gold be sure of that What would you do she asked What A world of things We d dress finely you and I I mean not Grip keep horses dogs wear bright colours and feathers do no more work live delicately and at our ease Oh we d find uses for it mother and uses that would do us good I would I knew where gold was buried How hard I d work to dig it up You do not know said his mother rising from her seat and laying her hand upon his shoulder what men have done to win it and how they have found too late that it glitters brightest at a distance and turns quite dim and dull when handled Ay ay so you say so you think he answered still looking eagerly in the same direction For all that mother I should like to try Do you not see she said how red it is Nothing bears so many stains of blood as gold Avoid it None have such cause to hate its name as we have Do not so much as think of it dear love It has brought such misery and suffering on your head and mine as few have known and God grant few may have to undergo I would rather we were dead and laid down in our graves than you should ever come to love it For a moment Barnaby withdrew his eyes and looked at her with wonder Then glancing from the redness in the sky to the mark upon his wrist as if he would compare the two he seemed about to question her with earnestness when a new object caught his wandering attention and made him quite forgetful of his purpose This was a man with dusty feet and garments who stood bare headed behind the hedge that divided their patch of garden from the pathway and leant meekly forward as if he sought to mingle with their conversation and waited for his time to speak His face was turned towards the brightness too but the light that fell upon it showed that he was blind and saw it not A blessing on those voices said the wayfarer I feel the beauty of the night more keenly when I hear them They are like eyes to me Will they speak again and cheer the heart of a poor traveller Have you no guide asked the widow after a moment s pause None but that he answered pointing with his staff towards the sun and sometimes a milder one at night but she is idle now Have you travelled far A weary way and long rejoined the traveller as he shook his head A weary weary way I struck my stick just now upon the bucket of your well be pleased to let me have a draught of water lady Why do you call me lady she returned I am as poor as you Your speech is soft and gentle and I judge by that replied the man The coarsest stuffs and finest silks are apart from the sense of touch alike to me I cannot judge you by your dress Come round this way said Barnaby who had passed out at the garden gate and now stood close beside him Put your hand in mine You re blind and always in the dark eh Are you frightened in the dark Do you see great crowds of faces now Do they grin and chatter Alas returned the other I see nothing Waking or sleeping nothing Barnaby looked curiously at his eyes and touching them with his fingers as an inquisitive child might led him towards the house You have come a long distance said the widow meeting him at the door How have you found your way so far Use and necessity are good teachers as I have heard the best of any said the blind man sitting down upon the chair to which Barnaby had led him and putting his hat and stick upon the red tiled floor May neither you nor your son ever learn under them They are rough masters You have wandered from the road too said the widow in a tone of pity Maybe maybe returned the blind man with a sigh and yet with something of a smile upon his face that s likely Handposts and milestones are dumb indeed to me Thank you the more for this rest and this refreshing drink As he spoke he raised the mug of water to his mouth It was clear and cold and sparkling but not to his taste nevertheless or his thirst was not very great for he only wetted his lips and put it down again He wore hanging with a long strap round his neck a kind of scrip or wallet in which to carry food The widow set some bread and cheese before him but he thanked her and said that through the kindness of the charitable he had broken his fast once since morning and was not hungry When he had made her this reply he opened his wallet and took out a few pence which was all it appeared to contain Might I make bold to ask he said turning towards where Barnaby stood looking on that one who has the gift of sight would lay this out for me in bread to keep me on my way Heaven s blessing on the young feet that will bestir themselves in aid of one so helpless as a sightless man Barnaby looked at his mother who nodded assent in another moment he was gone upon his charitable errand The blind man sat listening with an attentive face until long after the sound of his retreating footsteps was inaudible to the widow and then said suddenly and in a very altered tone There are various degrees and kinds of blindness widow There is the connubial blindness ma am which perhaps you may have observed in the course of your own experience and which is a kind of wilful and self bandaging blindness There is the blindness of party ma am and public men which is the blindness of a mad bull in the midst of a regiment of soldiers clothed in red There is the blind confidence of youth which is the blindness of young kittens whose eyes have not yet opened on the world and there is that physical blindness ma am of which I am contrairy to my own desire a most illustrious example Added to these ma am is that blindness of the intellect of which we have a specimen in your interesting son and which having sometimes glimmerings and dawnings of the light is scarcely to be trusted as a total darkness Therefore ma am I have taken the liberty to get him out of the way for a short time while you and I confer together and this precaution arising out of the delicacy of my sentiments towards yourself you will excuse me ma am I know Having delivered himself of this speech with many flourishes of manner he drew from beneath his coat a flat stone bottle and holding the cork between his teeth qualified his mug of water with a plentiful infusion of the liquor it contained He politely drained the bumper to her health and the ladies and setting it down empty smacked his lips with infinite relish I am a citizen of the world ma am said the blind man corking his bottle and if I seem to conduct myself with freedom it is therefore You wonder who I am ma am and what has brought me here Such experience of human nature as I have leads me to that conclusion without the aid of eyes by which to read the movements of your soul as depicted in your feminine features I will satisfy your curiosity immediately ma am immediately With that he slapped his bottle on its broad back and having put it under his garment as before crossed his legs and folded his hands and settled himself in his chair previous to proceeding any further The change in his manner was so unexpected the craft and wickedness of his deportment were so much aggravated by his condition for we are accustomed to see in those who have lost a human sense something in its place almost divine and this alteration bred so many fears in her whom he addressed that she could not pronounce one word After waiting as it seemed for some remark or answer and waiting in vain the visitor resumed Madam my name is Stagg A friend of mine who has desired the honour of meeting with you any time these five years past has commissioned me to call upon you I should be glad to whisper that gentleman s name in your ear Zounds ma am are you deaf Do you hear me say that I should be glad to whisper my friend s name in your ear You need not repeat it said the widow with a stifled groan I see too well from whom you come But as a man of honour ma am said the blind man striking himself on the breast whose credentials must not be disputed I take leave to say that I WILL mention that gentleman s name Ay ay he added seeming to catch with his quick ear the very motion of her hand but not aloud With your leave ma am I desire the favour of a whisper She moved towards him and stooped down He muttered a word in her ear and wringing her hands she paced up and down the room like one distracted The blind man with perfect composure produced his bottle again mixed another glassful put it up as before and drinking from time to time followed her with his face in silence You are slow in conversation widow he said after a time pausing in his draught We shall have to talk before your son What would you have me do she answered What do you want We are poor widow we are poor he retorted stretching out his right hand and rubbing his thumb upon its palm Poor she cried And what am I Comparisons are odious said the blind man I don t know I don t care I say that we are poor My friend s circumstances are indifferent and so are mine We must have our rights widow or we must be bought off But you know that as well as I so where is the use of talking She still walked wildly to and fro At length stopping abruptly before him she said Is he near here He is Close at hand Then I am lost Not lost widow said the blind man calmly only found Shall I call him Not for the world she answered with a shudder Very good he replied crossing his legs again for he had made as though he would rise and walk to the door As you please widow His presence is not necessary that I know of But both he and I must live to live we must eat and drink to eat and drink we must have money I say no more Do you know how pinched and destitute I am she retorted I do not think you do or can If you had eyes and could look around you on this poor place you would have pity on me Oh let your heart be softened by your own affliction friend and have some sympathy with mine The blind man snapped his fingers as he answered Beside the question ma am beside the question I have the softest heart in the world but I can t live upon it Many a gentleman lives well upon a soft head who would find a heart of the same quality a very great drawback Listen to me This is a matter of business with which sympathies and sentiments have nothing to do As a mutual friend I wish to arrange it in a satisfactory manner if possible and thus the case stands If you are very poor now it s your own choice You have friends who in case of need are always ready to help you My friend is in a more destitute and desolate situation than most men and you and he being linked together in a common cause he naturally looks to you to assist him He has boarded and lodged with me a long time for as I said just now I am very soft hearted and I quite approve of his entertaining this opinion You have always had a roof over your head he has always been an outcast You have your son to comfort and assist you he has nobody at all The advantages must not be all one side You are in the same boat and we must divide the ballast a little more equally She was about to speak but he checked her and went on The only way of doing this is by making up a little purse now and then for my friend and that s what I advise He bears you no malice that I know of ma am so little that although you have treated him harshly more than once and driven him I may say out of doors he has that regard for you that I believe even if you disappointed him now he would consent to take charge of your son and to make a man of him He laid a great stress on these latter words and paused as if to find out what effect they had produced She only answered by her tears He is a likely lad said the blind man thoughtfully for many purposes and not ill disposed to try his fortune in a little change and bustle if I may judge from what I heard of his talk with you to night Come In a word my friend has pressing necessity for twenty pounds You who can give up an annuity can get that sum for him It s a pity you should be troubled You seem very comfortable here and it s worth that much to remain so Twenty pounds widow is a moderate demand You know where to apply for it a post will bring it you Twenty pounds She was about to answer him again but again he stopped her Don t say anything hastily you might be sorry for it Think of it a little while Twenty pounds of other people s money how easy Turn it over in your mind I m in no hurry Night s coming on and if I don t sleep here I shall not go far Twenty pounds Consider of it ma am for twenty minutes give each pound a minute that s a fair allowance I ll enjoy the air the while which is very mild and pleasant in these parts With these words he groped his way to the door carrying his chair with him Then seating himself under a spreading honeysuckle and stretching his legs across the threshold so that no person could pass in or out without his knowledge he took from his pocket a pipe flint steel and tinder box and began to smoke It was a lovely evening of that gentle kind and at that time of year when the twilight is most beautiful Pausing now and then to let his smoke curl slowly off and to sniff the grateful fragrance of the flowers he sat there at his ease as though the cottage were his proper dwelling and he had held undisputed possession of it all his life waiting for the widow s answer and for Barnaby s return Chapter 46 When Barnaby returned with the bread the sight of the pious old pilgrim smoking his pipe and making himself so thoroughly at home appeared to surprise even him the more so as that worthy person instead of putting up the loaf in his wallet as a scarce and precious article tossed it carelessly on the table and producing his bottle bade him sit down and drink For I carry some comfort you see he said Taste that Is it good The water stood in Barnaby s eyes as he coughed from the strength of the draught and answered in the affirmative Drink some more said the blind man don t be afraid of it You don t taste anything like that often eh Often cried Barnaby Never Too poor returned the blind man with a sigh Ay That s bad Your mother poor soul would be happier if she was richer Barnaby Why so I tell her the very thing I told her just before you came to night when all that gold was in the sky said Barnaby drawing his chair nearer to him and looking eagerly in his face Tell me Is there any way of being rich that I could find out Any way A hundred ways Ay ay he returned Do you say so What are they Nay mother it s for your sake I ask not mine for yours indeed What are they The blind man turned his face on which there was a smile of triumph to where the widow stood in great distress and answered Why they are not to be found out by stay at homes my good friend By stay at homes cried Barnaby plucking at his sleeve But I am not one Now there you mistake I am often out before the sun and travel home when he has gone to rest I am away in the woods before the day has reached the shady places and am often there when the bright moon is peeping through the boughs and looking down upon the other moon that lives in the water As I walk along I try to find among the grass and moss some of that small money for which she works so hard and used to shed so many tears As I lie asleep in the shade I dream of it dream of digging it up in heaps and spying it out hidden under bushes and seeing it sparkle as the dew drops do among the leaves But I never find it Tell me where it is I d go there if the journey were a whole year long because I know she would be happier when I came home and brought some with me Speak again I ll listen to you if you talk all night The blind man passed his hand lightly over the poor fellow s face and finding that his elbows were planted on the table that his chin rested on his two hands that he leaned eagerly forward and that his whole manner expressed the utmost interest and anxiety paused for a minute as though he desired the widow to observe this fully and then made answer It s in the world bold Barnaby the merry world not in solitary places like those you pass your time in but in crowds and where there s noise and rattle Good good cried Barnaby rubbing his hands Yes I love that Grip loves it too It suits us both That s brave The kind of places said the blind man that a young fellow likes and in which a good son may do more for his mother and himself to boot in a month than he could here in all his life that is if he had a friend you know and some one to advise with You hear this mother cried Barnaby turning to her with delight Never tell me we shouldn t heed it if it lay shining at out feet Why do we heed it so much now Why do you toil from morning until night Surely said the blind man surely Have you no answer widow Is your mind he slowly added not made up yet Let me speak with you she answered apart Lay your hand upon my sleeve said Stagg arising from the table and lead me where you will Courage bold Barnaby We ll talk more of this I ve a fancy for you Wait there till I come back Now widow She led him out at the door and into the little garden where they stopped You are a fit agent she said in a half breathless manner and well represent the man who sent you here I ll tell him that you said so Stagg retorted He has a regard for you and will respect me the more if possible for your praise We must have our rights widow Rights Do you know she said that a word from me Why do you stop returned the blind man calmly after a long pause Do I know that a word from you would place my friend in the last position of the dance of life Yes I do What of that It will never be spoken widow You are sure of that Quite so sure that I don t come here to discuss the question I say we must have our rights or we must be bought off Keep to that point or let me return to my young friend for I have an interest in the lad and desire to put him in the way of making his fortune Bah you needn t speak he added hastily I know what you would say you have hinted at it once already Have I no feeling for you because I am blind No I have not Why do you expect me being in darkness to be better than men who have their sight why should you Is the hand of Heaven more manifest in my having no eyes than in your having two It s the cant of you folks to be horrified if a blind man robs or lies or steals oh yes it s far worse in him who can barely live on the few halfpence that are thrown to him in streets than in you who can see and work and are not dependent on the mercies of the world A curse on you You who have five senses may be wicked at your pleasure we who have four and want the most important are to live and be moral on our affliction The true charity and justice of rich to poor all the world over He paused a moment when he had said these words and caught the sound of money jingling in her hand Well he cried quickly resuming his former manner That should lead to something The point widow First answer me one question she replied You say he is close at hand Has he left London Being close at hand widow it would seem he has returned the blind man I mean for good You know that Yes for good The truth is widow that his making a longer stay there might have had disagreeable consequences He has come away for that reason Listen said the widow telling some money out upon a bench beside them Count Six said the blind man listening attentively Any more They are the savings she answered of five years Six guineas He put out his hand for one of the coins felt it carefully put it between his teeth rung it on the bench and nodded to her to proceed These have been scraped together and laid by lest sickness or death should separate my son and me They have been purchased at the price of much hunger hard labour and want of rest If you CAN take them do on condition that you leave this place upon the instant and enter no more into that room where he sits now expecting your return Six guineas said the blind man shaking his head though of the fullest weight that were ever coined fall very far short of twenty pounds widow For such a sum as you know I must write to a distant part of the country To do that and receive an answer I must have time Two days said Stagg More Four days A week Return on this day week at the same hour but not to the house Wait at the corner of the lane Of course said the blind man with a crafty look I shall find you there Where else can I take refuge Is it not enough that you have made a beggar of me and that I have sacrificed my whole store so hardly earned to preserve this home Humph said the blind man after some consideration Set me with my face towards the point you speak of and in the middle of the road Is this the spot It is On this day week at sunset And think of him within doors For the present good night She made him no answer nor did he stop for any He went slowly away turning his head from time to time and stopping to listen as if he were curious to know whether he was watched by any one The shadows of night were closing fast around and he was soon lost in the gloom It was not however until she had traversed the lane from end to end and made sure that he was gone that she re entered the cottage and hurriedly barred the door and window Mother said Barnaby What is the matter Where is the blind man He is gone Gone he cried starting up I must have more talk with him Which way did he take I don t know she answered folding her arms about him You must not go out to night There are ghosts and dreams abroad Ay said Barnaby in a frightened whisper It is not safe to stir We must leave this place to morrow This place This cottage and the little garden mother Yes To morrow morning at sunrise We must travel to London lose ourselves in that wide place there would be some trace of us in any other town then travel on again and find some new abode Little persuasion was required to reconcile Barnaby to anything that promised change In another minute he was wild with delight in another full of grief at the prospect of parting with his friends the dogs in another wild again then he was fearful of what she had said to prevent his wandering abroad that night and full of terrors and strange questions His light heartedness in the end surmounted all his other feelings and lying down in his clothes to the end that he might be ready on the morrow he soon fell fast asleep before the poor turf fire His mother did not close her eyes but sat beside him watching Every breath of wind sounded in her ears like that dreaded footstep at the door or like that hand upon the latch and made the calm summer night a night of horror At length the welcome day appeared When she had made the little preparations which were needful for their journey and had prayed upon her knees with many tears she roused Barnaby who jumped up gaily at her summons His clothes were few enough and to carry Grip was a labour of love As the sun shed his earliest beams upon the earth they closed the door of their deserted home and turned away The sky was blue and bright The air was fresh and filled with a thousand perfumes Barnaby looked upward and laughed with all his heart But it was a day he usually devoted to a long ramble and one of the dogs the ugliest of them all came bounding up and jumping round him in the fulness of his joy He had to bid him go back in a surly tone and his heart smote him while he did so The dog retreated turned with a half incredulous half imploring look came a little back and stopped It was the last appeal of an old companion and a faithful friend cast off Barnaby could bear no more and as he shook his head and waved his playmate home he burst into tears Oh mother mother how mournful he will be when he scratches at the door and finds it always shut There was such a sense of home in the thought that though her own eyes overflowed she would not have obliterated the recollection of it either from her own mind or from his for the wealth of the whole wide world Chapter 47 In the exhaustless catalogue of Heaven s mercies to mankind the power we have of finding some germs of comfort in the hardest trials must ever occupy the foremost place not only because it supports and upholds us when we most require to be sustained but because in this source of consolation there is something we have reason to believe of the divine spirit something of that goodness which detects amidst our own evil doings a redeeming quality something which even in our fallen nature we possess in common with the angels which had its being in the old time when they trod the earth and lingers on it yet in pity How often on their journey did the widow remember with a grateful heart that out of his deprivation Barnaby s cheerfulness and affection sprung How often did she call to mind that but for that he might have been sullen morose unkind far removed from her vicious perhaps and cruel How often had she cause for comfort in his strength and hope and in his simple nature Those feeble powers of mind which rendered him so soon forgetful of the past save in brief gleams and flashes even they were a comfort now The world to him was full of happiness in every tree and plant and flower in every bird and beast and tiny insect whom a breath of summer wind laid low upon the ground he had delight His delight was hers and where many a wise son would have made her sorrowful this poor light hearted idiot filled her breast with thankfulness and love Their stock of money was low but from the hoard she had told into the blind man s hand the widow had withheld one guinea This with the few pence she possessed besides was to two persons of their frugal habits a goodly sum in bank Moreover they had Grip in company and when they must otherwise have changed the guinea it was but to make him exhibit outside an alehouse door or in a village street or in the grounds or gardens of a mansion of the better sort and scores who would have given nothing in charity were ready to bargain for more amusement from the talking bird One day for they moved slowly and although they had many rides in carts and waggons were on the road a week Barnaby with Grip upon his shoulder and his mother following begged permission at a trim lodge to go up to the great house at the other end of the avenue and show his raven The man within was inclined to give them admittance and was indeed about to do so when a stout gentleman with a long whip in his hand and a flushed face which seemed to indicate that he had had his morning s draught rode up to the gate and called in a loud voice and with more oaths than the occasion seemed to warrant to have it opened directly Who hast thou got here said the gentleman angrily as the man threw the gate wide open and pulled off his hat who are these Eh art a beggar woman The widow answered with a curtsey that they were poor travellers Vagrants said the gentleman vagrants and vagabonds Thee wish to be made acquainted with the cage dost thee the cage the stocks and the whipping post Where dost come from She told him in a timid manner for he was very loud hoarse and red faced and besought him not to be angry for they meant no harm and would go upon their way that moment Don t he too sure of that replied the gentleman we don t allow vagrants to roam about this place I know what thou want st stray linen drying on hedges and stray poultry eh What hast got in that basket lazy hound Grip Grip Grip Grip the clever Grip the wicked Grip the knowing Grip Grip Grip cried the raven whom Barnaby had shut up on the approach of this stern personage I m a devil I m a devil I m a devil Never say die Hurrah Bow wow wow Polly put the kettle on we ll all have tea Take the vermin out scoundrel said the gentleman and let me see him Barnaby thus condescendingly addressed produced his bird but not without much fear and trembling and set him down upon the ground which he had no sooner done than Grip drew fifty corks at least and then began to dance at the same time eyeing the gentleman with surprising insolence of manner and screwing his head so much on one side that he appeared desirous of screwing it off upon the spot The cork drawing seemed to make a greater impression on the gentleman s mind than the raven s power of speech and was indeed particularly adapted to his habits and capacity He desired to have that done again but despite his being very peremptory and notwithstanding that Barnaby coaxed to the utmost Grip turned a deaf ear to the request and preserved a dead silence Bring him along said the gentleman pointing to the house But Grip who had watched the action anticipated his master by hopping on before them constantly flapping his wings and screaming cook meanwhile as a hint perhaps that there was company coming and a small collation would be acceptable Barnaby and his mother walked on on either side of the gentleman on horseback who surveyed each of them from time to time in a proud and coarse manner and occasionally thundered out some question the tone of which alarmed Barnaby so much that he could find no answer and as a matter of course could make him no reply On one of these occasions when the gentleman appeared disposed to exercise his horsewhip the widow ventured to inform him in a low voice and with tears in her eyes that her son was of weak mind An idiot eh said the gentleman looking at Barnaby as he spoke And how long hast thou been an idiot She knows was Barnaby s timid answer pointing to his mother I always I believe From his birth said the widow I don t believe it cried the gentleman not a bit of it It s an excuse not to work There s nothing like flogging to cure that disorder I d make a difference in him in ten minutes I ll be bound Heaven has made none in more than twice ten years sir said the widow mildly Then why don t you shut him up we pay enough for county institutions damn em But thou d rather drag him about to excite charity of course Ay I know thee Now this gentleman had various endearing appellations among his intimate friends By some he was called a country gentleman of the true school by some a fine old country gentleman by some a sporting gentleman by some a thorough bred Englishman by some a genuine John Bull but they all agreed in one respect and that was that it was a pity there were not more like him and that because there were not the country was going to rack and ruin every day He was in the commission of the peace and could write his name almost legibly but his greatest qualifications were that he was more severe with poachers was a better shot a harder rider had better horses kept better dogs could eat more solid food drink more strong wine go to bed every night more drunk and get up every morning more sober than any man in the county In knowledge of horseflesh he was almost equal to a farrier in stable learning he surpassed his own head groom and in gluttony not a pig on his estate was a match for him He had no seat in Parliament himself but he was extremely patriotic and usually drove his voters up to the poll with his own hands He was warmly attached to church and state and never appointed to the living in his gift any but a three bottle man and a first rate fox hunter He mistrusted the honesty of all poor people who could read and write and had a secret jealousy of his own wife a young lady whom he had married for what his friends called the good old English reason that her father s property adjoined his own for possessing those accomplishments in a greater degree than himself In short Barnaby being an idiot and Grip a creature of mere brute instinct it would be very hard to say what this gentleman was He rode up to the door of a handsome house approached by a great flight of steps where a man was waiting to take his horse and led the way into a large hall which spacious as it was was tainted with the fumes of last night s stale debauch Greatcoats riding whips bridles top boots spurs and such gear were strewn about on all sides and formed with some huge stags antlers and a few portraits of dogs and horses its principal embellishments Throwing himself into a great chair in which by the bye he often snored away the night when he had been according to his admirers a finer country gentleman than usual he bade the man to tell his mistress to come down and presently there appeared a little flurried as it seemed by the unwonted summons a lady much younger than himself who had the appearance of being in delicate health and not too happy Here Thou st no delight in following the hounds as an Englishwoman should have said the gentleman See to this here That ll please thee perhaps The lady smiled sat down at a little distance from him and glanced at Barnaby with a look of pity He s an idiot the woman says observed the gentleman shaking his head I don t believe it Are you his mother asked the lady She answered yes What s the use of asking HER said the gentleman thrusting his hands into his breeches pockets She ll tell thee so of course Most likely he s hired at so much a day There Get on Make him do something Grip having by this time recovered his urbanity condescended at Barnaby s solicitation to repeat his various phrases of speech and to go through the whole of his performances with the utmost success The corks and the never say die afforded the gentleman so much delight that he demanded the repetition of this part of the entertainment until Grip got into his basket and positively refused to say another word good or bad The lady too was much amused with him and the closing point of his obstinacy so delighted her husband that he burst into a roar of laughter and demanded his price Barnaby looked as though he didn t understand his meaning Probably he did not His price said the gentleman rattling the money in his pockets what dost want for him How much He s not to be sold replied Barnaby shutting up the basket in a great hurry and throwing the strap over his shoulder Mother come away Thou seest how much of an idiot he is book learner said the gentleman looking scornfully at his wife He can make a bargain What dost want for him old woman He is my son s constant companion said the widow He is not to be sold sir indeed Not to be sold cried the gentleman growing ten times redder hoarser and louder than before Not to be sold Indeed no she answered We have never thought of parting with him sir I do assure you He was evidently about to make a very passionate retort when a few murmured words from his wife happening to catch his ear he turned sharply round and said Eh What We can hardly expect them to sell the bird against their own desire she faltered If they prefer to keep him Prefer to keep him he echoed These people who go tramping about the country a pilfering and vagabondising on all hands prefer to keep a bird when a landed proprietor and a justice asks his price That old woman s been to school I know she has Don t tell me no he roared to the widow I say yes Barnaby s mother pleaded guilty to the accusation and hoped there was no harm in it No harm said the gentleman No No harm No harm ye old rebel not a bit of harm If my clerk was here I d set ye in the stocks I would or lay ye in jail for prowling up and down on the look out for petty larcenies ye limb of a gipsy Here Simon put these pilferers out shove em into the road out with em Ye don t want to sell the bird ye that come here to beg don t ye If they an t out in double quick set the dogs upon em They waited for no further dismissal but fled precipitately leaving the gentleman to storm away by himself for the poor lady had already retreated and making a great many vain attempts to silence Grip who excited by the noise drew corks enough for a city feast as they hurried down the avenue and appeared to congratulate himself beyond measure on having been the cause of the disturbance When they had nearly reached the lodge another servant emerging from the shrubbery feigned to be very active in ordering them off but this man put a crown into the widow s hand and whispering that his lady sent it thrust them gently from the gate This incident only suggested to the widow s mind when they halted at an alehouse some miles further on and heard the justice s character as given by his friends that perhaps something more than capacity of stomach and tastes for the kennel and the stable were required to form either a perfect country gentleman a thoroughbred Englishman or a genuine John Bull and that possibly the terms were sometimes misappropriated not to say disgraced She little thought then that a circumstance so slight would ever influence their future fortunes but time and experience enlightened her in this respect Mother said Barnaby as they were sitting next day in a waggon which was to take them within ten miles of the capital we re going to London first you said Shall we see that blind man there She was about to answer Heaven forbid but checked herself and told him No she thought not why did he ask He s a wise man said Barnaby with a thoughtful countenance I wish that we may meet with him again What was it that he said of crowds That gold was to be found where people crowded and not among the trees and in such quiet places He spoke as if he loved it London is a crowded place I think we shall meet him there But why do you desire to see him love she asked Because said Barnaby looking wistfully at her he talked to me about gold which is a rare thing and say what you will a thing you would like to have I know And because he came and went away so strangely just as white headed old men come sometimes to my bed s foot in the night and say what I can t remember when the bright day returns He told me he d come back I wonder why he broke his word But you never thought of being rich or gay before dear Barnaby You have always been contented He laughed and bade her say that again then cried Ay ay oh yes and laughed once more Then something passed that caught his fancy and the topic wandered from his mind and was succeeded by another just as fleeting But it was plain from what he had said and from his returning to the point more than once that day and on the next that the blind man s visit and indeed his words had taken strong possession of his mind Whether the idea of wealth had occurred to him for the first time on looking at the golden clouds that evening and images were often presented to his thoughts by outward objects quite as remote and distant or whether their poor and humble way of life had suggested it by contrast long ago or whether the accident as he would deem it of the blind man s pursuing the current of his own remarks had done so at the moment or he had been impressed by the mere circumstance of the man being blind and therefore unlike any one with whom he had talked before it was impossible to tell She tried every means to discover but in vain and the probability is that Barnaby himself was equally in the dark It filled her with uneasiness to find him harping on this string but all that she could do was to lead him quickly to some other subject and to dismiss it from his brain To caution him against their visitor to show any fear or suspicion in reference to him would only be she feared to increase that interest with which Barnaby regarded him and to strengthen his desire to meet him once again She hoped by plunging into the crowd to rid herself of her terrible pursuer and then by journeying to a distance and observing increased caution if that were possible to live again unknown in secrecy and peace They reached in course of time their halting place within ten miles of London and lay there for the night after bargaining to be carried on for a trifle next day in a light van which was returning empty and was to start at five o clock in the morning The driver was punctual the road good save for the dust the weather being very hot and dry and at seven in the forenoon of Friday the second of June one thousand seven hundred and eighty they alighted at the foot of Westminster Bridge bade their conductor farewell and stood alone together on the scorching pavement For the freshness which night sheds upon such busy thoroughfares had already departed and the sun was shining with uncommon lustre Chapter 48 Uncertain where to go next and bewildered by the crowd of people who were already astir they sat down in one of the recesses on the bridge to rest They soon became aware that the stream of life was all pouring one way and that a vast throng of persons were crossing the river from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore in unusual haste and evident excitement They were for the most part in knots of two or three or sometimes half a dozen they spoke little together many of them were quite silent and hurried on as if they had one absorbing object in view which was common to them all They were surprised to see that nearly every man in this great concourse which still came pouring past without slackening in the least wore in his hat a blue cockade and that the chance passengers who were not so decorated appeared timidly anxious to escape observation or attack and gave them the wall as if they would conciliate them This however was natural enough considering their inferiority in point of numbers for the proportion of those who wore blue cockades to those who were dressed as usual was at least forty or fifty to one There was no quarrelling however the blue cockades went swarming on passing each other when they could and making all the speed that was possible in such a multitude and exchanged nothing more than looks and very often not even those with such of the passers by as were not of their number At first the current of people had been confined to the two pathways and but a few more eager stragglers kept the road But after half an hour or so the passage was completely blocked up by the great press which being now closely wedged together and impeded by the carts and coaches it encountered moved but slowly and was sometimes at a stand for five or ten minutes together After the lapse of nearly two hours the numbers began to diminish visibly and gradually dwindling away by little and little left the bridge quite clear save that now and then some hot and dusty man with the cockade in his hat and his coat thrown over his shoulder went panting by fearful of being too late or stopped to ask which way his friends had taken and being directed hastened on again like one refreshed In this comparative solitude which seemed quite strange and novel after the late crowd the widow had for the first time an opportunity of inquiring of an old man who came and sat beside them what was the meaning of that great assemblage Why where have you come from he returned that you haven t heard of Lord George Gordon s great association This is the day that he presents the petition against the Catholics God bless him What have all these men to do with that she said What have they to do with it the old man replied Why how you talk Don t you know his lordship has declared he won t present it to the house at all unless it is attended to the door by forty thousand good and true men at least There s a crowd for you A crowd indeed said Barnaby Do you hear that mother And they re mustering yonder as I am told resumed the old man nigh upon a hundred thousand strong Ah Let Lord George alone He knows his power There ll be a good many faces inside them three windows over there and he pointed to where the House of Commons overlooked the river that ll turn pale when good Lord George gets up this afternoon and with reason too Ay ay Let his lordship alone Let him alone HE knows And so with much mumbling and chuckling and shaking of his forefinger he rose with the assistance of his stick and tottered off Mother said Barnaby that s a brave crowd he talks of Come Not to join it cried his mother Yes yes he answered plucking at her sleeve Why not Come You don t know she urged what mischief they may do where they may lead you what their meaning is Dear Barnaby for my sake For your sake he cried patting her hand Well It IS for your sake mother You remember what the blind man said about the gold Here s a brave crowd Come Or wait till I come back yes yes wait here She tried with all the earnestness her fears engendered to turn him from his purpose but in vain He was stooping down to buckle on his shoe when a hackney coach passed them rather quickly and a voice inside called to the driver to stop Young man said a voice within Who s that cried Barnaby looking up Do you wear this ornament returned the stranger holding out a blue cockade In Heaven s name no Pray do not give it him exclaimed the widow Speak for yourself woman said the man within the coach coldly Leave the young man to his choice he s old enough to make it and to snap your apron strings He knows without your telling whether he wears the sign of a loyal Englishman or not Barnaby trembling with impatience cried Yes yes yes I do as he had cried a dozen times already The man threw him a cockade and crying Make haste to St George s Fields ordered the coachman to drive on fast and left them With hands that trembled with his eagerness to fix the bauble in his hat Barnaby was adjusting it as he best could and hurriedly replying to the tears and entreaties of his mother when two gentlemen passed on the opposite side of the way Observing them and seeing how Barnaby was occupied they stopped whispered together for an instant turned back and came over to them Why are you sitting here said one of them who was dressed in a plain suit of black wore long lank hair and carried a great cane Why have you not gone with the rest I am going sir replied Barnaby finishing his task and putting his hat on with an air of pride I shall be there directly Say my lord young man when his lordship does you the honour of speaking to you said the second gentleman mildly If you don t know Lord George Gordon when you see him it s high time you should Nay Gashford said Lord George as Barnaby pulled off his hat again and made him a low bow it s no great matter on a day like this which every Englishman will remember with delight and pride Put on your hat friend and follow us for you lag behind and are late It s past ten now Didn t you know that the hour for assembling was ten o clock Barnaby shook his head and looked vacantly from one to the other You might have known it friend said Gashford it was perfectly understood How came you to be so ill informed He cannot tell you sir the widow interposed It s of no use to ask him We are but this morning come from a long distance in the country and know nothing of these matters The cause has taken a deep root and has spread its branches far and wide said Lord George to his secretary This is a pleasant hearing I thank Heaven for it Amen cried Gashford with a solemn face You do not understand me my lord said the widow Pardon me but you cruelly mistake my meaning We know nothing of these matters We have no desire or right to join in what you are about to do This is my son my poor afflicted son dearer to me than my own life In mercy s name my lord go your way alone and do not tempt him into danger My good woman said Gashford how can you Dear me What do you mean by tempting and by danger Do you think his lordship is a roaring lion going about and seeking whom he may devour God bless me No no my lord forgive me implored the widow laying both her hands upon his breast and scarcely knowing what she did or said in the earnestness of her supplication but there are reasons why you should hear my earnest mother s prayer and leave my son with me Oh do He is not in his right senses he is not indeed It is a bad sign of the wickedness of these times said Lord George evading her touch and colouring deeply that those who cling to the truth and support the right cause are set down as mad Have you the heart to say this of your own son unnatural mother I am astonished at you said Gashford with a kind of meek severity This is a very sad picture of female depravity He has surely no appearance said Lord George glancing at Barnaby and whispering in his secretary s ear of being deranged And even if he had we must not construe any trifling peculiarity into madness Which of us and here he turned red again would be safe if that were made the law Not one replied the secretary in that case the greater the zeal the truth and talent the more direct the call from above the clearer would be the madness With regard to this young man my lord he added with a lip that slightly curled as he looked at Barnaby who stood twirling his hat and stealthily beckoning them to come away he is as sensible and self possessed as any one I ever saw And you desire to make one of this great body said Lord George addressing him and intended to make one did you Yes yes said Barnaby with sparkling eyes To be sure I did I told her so myself I see replied Lord George with a reproachful glance at the unhappy mother I thought so Follow me and this gentleman and you shall have your wish Barnaby kissed his mother tenderly on the cheek and bidding her be of good cheer for their fortunes were both made now did as he was desired She poor woman followed too with how much fear and grief it would be hard to tell They passed quickly through the Bridge Road where the shops were all shut up for the passage of the great crowd and the expectation of their return had alarmed the tradesmen for their goods and windows and where in the upper stories all the inhabitants were congregated looking down into the street below with faces variously expressive of alarm of interest expectancy and indignation Some of these applauded and some hissed but regardless of these interruptions for the noise of a vast congregation of people at a little distance sounded in his ears like the roaring of the sea Lord George Gordon quickened his pace and presently arrived before St George s Fields They were really fields at that time and of considerable extent Here an immense multitude was collected bearing flags of various kinds and sizes but all of the same colour blue like the cockades some sections marching to and fro in military array and others drawn up in circles squares and lines A large portion both of the bodies which paraded the ground and of those which remained stationary were occupied in singing hymns or psalms With whomsoever this originated it was well done for the sound of so many thousand voices in the air must have stirred the heart of any man within him and could not fail to have a wonderful effect upon enthusiasts however mistaken Scouts had been posted in advance of the great body to give notice of their leader s coming These falling back the word was quickly passed through the whole host and for a short interval there ensued a profound and deathlike silence during which the mass was so still and quiet that the fluttering of a banner caught the eye and became a circumstance of note Then they burst into a tremendous shout into another and another and the air seemed rent and shaken as if by the discharge of cannon Gashford cried Lord George pressing his secretary s arm tight within his own and speaking with as much emotion in his voice as in his altered face I arn called indeed now I feel and know it I am the leader of a host If they summoned me at this moment with one voice to lead them on to death I d do it Yes and fall first myself It is a proud sight said the secretary It is a noble day for England and for the great cause throughout the world Such homage my lord as I an humble but devoted man can render What are you doing cried his master catching him by both hands for he had made a show of kneeling at his feet Do not unfit me dear Gashford for the solemn duty of this glorious day the tears stood in the eyes of the poor gentleman as he said the words Let us go among them we have to find a place in some division for this new recruit give me your hand Gashford slid his cold insidious palm into his master s grasp and so hand in hand and followed still by Barnaby and by his mother too they mingled with the concourse They had by this time taken to their singing again and as their leader passed between their ranks they raised their voices to their utmost Many of those who were banded together to support the religion of their country even unto death had never heard a hymn or psalm in all their lives But these fellows having for the most part strong lungs and being naturally fond of singing chanted any ribaldry or nonsense that occurred to them feeling pretty certain that it would not be detected in the general chorus and not caring much if it were Many of these voluntaries were sung under the very nose of Lord George Gordon who quite unconscious of their burden passed on with his usual stiff and solemn deportment very much edified and delighted by the pious conduct of his followers So they went on and on up this line down that round the exterior of this circle and on every side of that hollow square and still there were lines and squares and circles out of number to review The day being now intensely hot and the sun striking down his fiercest rays upon the field those who carried heavy banners began to grow faint and weary most of the number assembled were fain to pull off their neckcloths and throw their coats and waistcoats open and some towards the centre quite overpowered by the excessive heat which was of course rendered more unendurable by the multitude around them lay down upon the grass and offered all they had about them for a drink of water Still no man left the ground not even of those who were so distressed still Lord George streaming from every pore went on with Gashford and still Barnaby and his mother followed close behind them They had arrived at the top of a long line of some eight hundred men in single file and Lord George had turned his head to look back when a loud cry of recognition in that peculiar and half stifled tone which a voice has when it is raised in the open air and in the midst of a great concourse of persons was heard and a man stepped with a shout of laughter from the rank and smote Barnaby on the shoulders with his heavy hand How now he cried Barnaby Rudge Why where have you been hiding for these hundred years Barnaby had been thinking within himself that the smell of the trodden grass brought back his old days at cricket when he was a young boy and played on Chigwell Green Confused by this sudden and boisterous address he stared in a bewildered manner at the man and could scarcely say What Hugh Hugh echoed the other ay Hugh Maypole Hugh You remember my dog He s alive now and will know you I warrant What you wear the colour do you Well done Ha ha ha You know this young man I see said Lord George Know him my lord as well as I know my own right hand My captain knows him We all know him Will you take him into your division It hasn t in it a better nor a nimbler nor a more active man than Barnaby Rudge said Hugh Show me the man who says it has Fall in Barnaby He shall march my lord between me and Dennis and he shall carry he added taking a flag from the hand of a tired man who tendered it the gayest silken streamer in this valiant army In the name of God no shrieked the widow darting forward Barnaby my lord see he ll come back Barnaby Barnaby Women in the field cried Hugh stepping between them and holding her off Holloa My captain there What s the matter here cried Simon Tappertit bustling up in a great heat Do you call this order Nothing like it captain answered Hugh still holding her back with his outstretched hand It s against all orders Ladies are carrying off our gallant soldiers from their duty The word of command captain They re filing off the ground Quick Close cried Simon with the whole power of his lungs Form March She was thrown to the ground the whole field was in motion Barnaby was whirled away into the heart of a dense mass of men and she saw him no more Chapter 49 The mob had been divided from its first assemblage into four divisions the London the Westminster the Southwark and the Scotch Each of these divisions being subdivided into various bodies and these bodies being drawn up in various forms and figures the general arrangement was except to the few chiefs and leaders as unintelligible as the plan of a great battle to the meanest soldier in the field It was not without its method however for in a very short space of time after being put in motion the crowd had resolved itself into three great parties and were prepared as had been arranged to cross the river by different bridges and make for the House of Commons in separate detachments At the head of that division which had Westminster Bridge for its approach to the scene of action Lord George Gordon took his post with Gashford at his right hand and sundry ruffians of most unpromising appearance forming a kind of staff about him The conduct of a second party whose route lay by Blackfriars was entrusted to a committee of management including perhaps a dozen men while the third which was to go by London Bridge and through the main streets in order that their numbers and their serious intentions might be the better known and appreciated by the citizens were led by Simon Tappertit assisted by a few subalterns selected from the Brotherhood of United Bulldogs Dennis the hangman Hugh and some others The word of command being given each of these great bodies took the road assigned to it and departed on its way in perfect order and profound silence That which went through the City greatly exceeded the others in number and was of such prodigious extent that when the rear began to move the front was nearly four miles in advance notwithstanding that the men marched three abreast and followed very close upon each other At the head of this party in the place where Hugh in the madness of his humour had stationed him and walking between that dangerous companion and the hangman went Barnaby as many a man among the thousands who looked on that day afterwards remembered well Forgetful of all other things in the ecstasy of the moment his face flushed and his eyes sparkling with delight heedless of the weight of the great banner he carried and mindful only of its flashing in the sun and rustling in the summer breeze on he went proud happy elated past all telling the only light hearted undesigning creature in the whole assembly What do you think of this asked Hugh as they passed through the crowded streets and looked up at the windows which were thronged with spectators They have all turned out to see our flags and streamers Eh Barnaby Why Barnaby s the greatest man of all the pack His flag s the largest of the lot the brightest too There s nothing in the show like Barnaby All eyes are turned on him Ha ha ha Don t make that din brother growled the hangman glancing with no very approving eyes at Barnaby as he spoke I hope he don t think there s nothing to be done but carrying that there piece of blue rag like a boy at a breaking up You re ready for action I hope eh You I mean he added nudging Barnaby roughly with his elbow What are you staring at Why don t you speak Barnaby had been gazing at his flag and looked vacantly from his questioner to Hugh He don t understand your way said the latter Here I ll explain it to him Barnaby old boy attend to me I ll attend said Barnaby looking anxiously round but I wish I could see her somewhere See who demanded Dennis in a gruff tone You an t in love I hope brother That an t the sort of thing for us you know We mustn t have no love here She would be proud indeed to see me now eh Hugh said Barnaby Wouldn t it make her glad to see me at the head of this large show She d cry for joy I know she would Where CAN she be She never sees me at my best and what do I care to be gay and fine if SHE S not by Why what palaver s this asked Mr Dennis with supreme disdain We an t got no sentimental members among us I hope Don t be uneasy brother cried Hugh he s only talking of his mother Of his what said Mr Dennis with a strong oath His mother And have I combined myself with this here section and turned out on this here memorable day to hear men talk about their mothers growled Mr Dennis with extreme disgust The notion of a man s sweetheart s bad enough but a man s mother and here his disgust was so extreme that he spat upon the ground and could say no more Barnaby s right cried Hugh with a grin and I say it Lookee bold lad If she s not here to see it s because I ve provided for her and sent half a dozen gentlemen every one of em with a blue flag but not half as fine as yours to take her in state to a grand house all hung round with gold and silver banners and everything else you please where she ll wait till you come and want for nothing Ay said Barnaby his face beaming with delight have you indeed That s a good hearing That s fine Kind Hugh But nothing to what will come bless you retorted Hugh with a wink at Dennis who regarded his new companion in arms with great astonishment No indeed cried Barnaby Nothing at all said Hugh Money cocked hats and feathers red coats and gold lace all the fine things there are ever were or will be will belong to us if we are true to that noble gentleman the best man in the world carry our flags for a few days and keep em safe That s all we ve got to do Is that all cried Barnaby with glistening eyes as he clutched his pole the tighter I warrant you I keep this one safe then You have put it in good hands You know me Hugh Nobody shall wrest this flag away Well said cried Hugh Ha ha Nobly said That s the old stout Barnaby that I have climbed and leaped with many and many a day I knew I was not mistaken in Barnaby Don t you see man he added in a whisper as he slipped to the other side of Dennis that the lad s a natural and can be got to do anything if you take him the right way Letting alone the fun he is he s worth a dozen men in earnest as you d find if you tried a fall with him Leave him to me You shall soon see whether he s of use or not Mr Dennis received these explanatory remarks with many nods and winks and softened his behaviour towards Barnaby from that moment Hugh laying his finger on his nose stepped back into his former place and they proceeded in silence It was between two and three o clock in the afternoon when the three great parties met at Westminster and uniting into one huge mass raised a tremendous shout This was not only done in token of their presence but as a signal to those on whom the task devolved that it was time to take possession of the lobbies of both Houses and of the various avenues of approach and of the gallery stairs To the last named place Hugh and Dennis still with their pupil between them rushed straightway Barnaby having given his flag into the hands of one of their own party who kept them at the outer door Their followers pressing on behind they were borne as on a great wave to the very doors of the gallery whence it was impossible to retreat even if they had been so inclined by reason of the throng which choked up the passages It is a familiar expression in describing a great crowd that a person might have walked upon the people s heads In this case it was actually done for a boy who had by some means got among the concourse and was in imminent danger of suffocation climbed to the shoulders of a man beside him and walked upon the people s hats and heads into the open street traversing in his passage the whole length of two staircases and a long gallery Nor was the swarm without less dense for a basket which had been tossed into the crowd was jerked from head to head and shoulder to shoulder and went spinning and whirling on above them until it was lost to view without ever once falling in among them or coming near the ground Through this vast throng sprinkled doubtless here and there with honest zealots but composed for the most part of the very scum and refuse of London whose growth was fostered by bad criminal laws bad prison regulations and the worst conceivable police such of the members of both Houses of Parliament as had not taken the precaution to be already at their posts were compelled to fight and force their way Their carriages were stopped and broken the wheels wrenched off the glasses shivered to atoms the panels beaten in drivers footmen and masters pulled from their seats and rolled in the mud Lords commoners and reverend bishops with little distinction of person or party were kicked and pinched and hustled passed from hand to hand through various stages of ill usage and sent to their fellow senators at last with their clothes hanging in ribands about them their bagwigs torn off themselves speechless and breathless and their persons covered with the powder which had been cuffed and beaten out of their hair One lord was so long in the hands of the populace that the Peers as a body resolved to sally forth and rescue him and were in the act of doing so when he happily appeared among them covered with dirt and bruises and hardly to be recognised by those who knew him best The noise and uproar were on the increase every moment The air was filled with execrations hoots and howlings The mob raged and roared like a mad monster as it was unceasingly and each new outrage served to swell its fury Within doors matters were even yet more threatening Lord George preceded by a man who carried the immense petition on a porter s knot through the lobby to the door of the House of Commons where it was received by two officers of the house who rolled it up to the table ready for presentation had taken his seat at an early hour before the Speaker went to prayers His followers pouring in at the same time the lobby and all the avenues were immediately filled as we have seen Thus the members were not only attacked in their passage through the streets but were set upon within the very walls of Parliament while the tumult both within and without was so great that those who attempted to speak could scarcely hear their own voices far less consult upon the course it would be wise to take in such extremity or animate each other to dignified and firm resistance So sure as any member just arrived with dress disordered and dishevelled hair came struggling through the crowd in the lobby it yelled and screamed in triumph and when the door of the House partially and cautiously opened by those within for his admission gave them a momentary glimpse of the interior they grew more wild and savage like beasts at the sight of prey and made a rush against the portal which strained its locks and bolts in their staples and shook the very beams The strangers gallery which was immediately above the door of the House had been ordered to be closed on the first rumour of disturbance and was empty save that now and then Lord George took his seat there for the convenience of coming to the head of the stairs which led to it and repeating to the people what had passed within It was on these stairs that Barnaby Hugh and Dennis were posted There were two flights short steep and narrow running parallel to each other and leading to two little doors communicating with a low passage which opened on the gallery Between them was a kind of well or unglazed skylight for the admission of light and air into the lobby which might be some eighteen or twenty feet below Upon one of these little staircases not that at the head of which Lord George appeared from time to time but the other Gashford stood with his elbow on the bannister and his cheek resting on his hand with his usual crafty aspect Whenever he varied this attitude in the slightest degree so much as by the gentlest motion of his arm the uproar was certain to increase not merely there but in the lobby below from which place no doubt some man who acted as fugleman to the rest was constantly looking up and watching him Order cried Hugh in a voice which made itself heard even above the roar and tumult as Lord George appeared at the top of the staircase News News from my lord The noise continued notwithstanding his appearance until Gashford looked round There was silence immediately even among the people in the passages without and on the other staircases who could neither see nor hear but to whom notwithstanding the signal was conveyed with marvellous rapidity Gentlemen said Lord George who was very pale and agitated we must be firm They talk of delays but we must have no delays They talk of taking your petition into consideration next Tuesday but we must have it considered now Present appearances look bad for our success but we must succeed and will We must succeed and will echoed the crowd And so among their shouts and cheers and other cries he bowed to them and retired and presently came back again There was another gesture from Gashford and a dead silence directly I am afraid he said this time that we have little reason gentlemen to hope for any redress from the proceedings of Parliament But we must redress our own grievances we must meet again we must put our trust in Providence and it will bless our endeavours This speech being a little more temperate than the last was not so favourably received When the noise and exasperation were at their height he came back once more and told them that the alarm had gone forth for many miles round that when the King heard of their assembling together in that great body he had no doubt His Majesty would send down private orders to have their wishes complied with and with the manner of his speech as childish irresolute and uncertain as his matter was proceeding in this strain when two gentlemen suddenly appeared at the door where he stood and pressing past him and coming a step or two lower down upon the stairs confronted the people The boldness of this action quite took them by surprise They were not the less disconcerted when one of the gentlemen turning to Lord George spoke thus in a loud voice that they might hear him well but quite coolly and collectedly You may tell these people if you please my lord that I am General Conway of whom they have heard and that I oppose this petition and all their proceedings and yours I am a soldier you may tell them and I will protect the freedom of this place with my sword You see my lord that the members of this House are all in arms to day you know that the entrance to it is a narrow one you cannot be ignorant that there are men within these walls who are determined to defend that pass to the last and before whom many lives must fall if your adherents persevere Have a care what you do And my Lord George said the other gentleman addressing him in like manner I desire them to hear this from me Colonel Gordon your near relation If a man among this crowd whose uproar strikes us deaf crosses the threshold of the House of Commons I swear to run my sword that moment not into his but into your body With that they stepped back again keeping their faces towards the crowd took each an arm of the misguided nobleman drew him into the passage and shut the door which they directly locked and fastened on the inside This was so quickly done and the demeanour of both gentlemen who were not young men either was so gallant and resolute that the crowd faltered and stared at each other with irresolute and timid looks Many tried to turn towards the door some of the faintest hearted cried they had best go back and called to those behind to give way and the panic and confusion were increasing rapidly when Gashford whispered Hugh What now Hugh roared aloud turning towards them Why go back Where can you do better than here boys One good rush against these doors and one below at the same time will do the business Rush on then As to the door below let those stand back who are afraid Let those who are not afraid try who shall be the first to pass it Here goes Look out down there Without the delay of an instant he threw himself headlong over the bannisters into the lobby below He had hardly touched the ground when Barnaby was at his side The chaplain s assistant and some members who were imploring the people to retire immediately withdrew and then with a great shout both crowds threw themselves against the doors pell mell and besieged the House in earnest At that moment when a second onset must have brought them into collision with those who stood on the defensive within in which case great loss of life and bloodshed would inevitably have ensued the hindmost portion of the crowd gave way and the rumour spread from mouth to mouth that a messenger had been despatched by water for the military who were forming in the street Fearful of sustaining a charge in the narrow passages in which they were so closely wedged together the throng poured out as impetuously as they had flocked in As the whole stream turned at once Barnaby and Hugh went with it and so fighting and struggling and trampling on fallen men and being trampled on in turn themselves they and the whole mass floated by degrees into the open street where a large detachment of the Guards both horse and foot came hurrying up clearing the ground before them so rapidly that the people seemed to melt away as they advanced The word of command to halt being given the soldiers formed across the street the rioters breathless and exhausted with their late exertions formed likewise though in a very irregular and disorderly manner The commanding officer rode hastily into the open space between the two bodies accompanied by a magistrate and an officer of the House of Commons for whose accommodation a couple of troopers had hastily dismounted The Riot Act was read but not a man stirred In the first rank of the insurgents Barnaby and Hugh stood side by side Somebody had thrust into Barnaby s hands when he came out into the street his precious flag which being now rolled up and tied round the pole looked like a giant quarter staff as he grasped it firmly and stood upon his guard If ever man believed with his whole heart and soul that he was engaged in a just cause and that he was bound to stand by his leader to the last poor Barnaby believed it of himself and Lord George Gordon After an ineffectual attempt to make himself heard the magistr e gave the word and the Horse Guards came riding in among the crowd But even then he galloped here and there exhorting the people to disperse and although heavy stones were thrown at the men and some were desperately cut and bruised they had no orders but to make prisoners of such of the rioters as were the most active and to drive the people back with the flat of their sabres As the horses came in among them the throng gave way at many points and the Guards following up their advantage were rapidly clearing the ground when two or three of the foremost who were in a manner cut off from the rest by the people closing round them made straight towards Barnaby and Hugh who had no doubt been pointed out as the two men who dropped into the lobby laying about them now with some effect and inflicting on the more turbulent of their opponents a few slight flesh wounds under the influence of which a man dropped here and there into the arms of his fellows amid much groaning and confusion At the sight of gashed and bloody faces seen for a moment in the crowd then hidden by the press around them Barnaby turned pale and sick But he stood his ground and grasping his pole more firmly yet kept his eye fixed upon the nearest soldier nodding his head meanwhile as Hugh with a scowling visage whispered in his ear The soldier came spurring on making his horse rear as the people pressed about him cutting at the hands of those who would have grasped his rein and forced his charger back and waving to his comrades to follow and still Barnaby without retreating an inch waited for his coming Some called to him to fly and some were in the very act of closing round him to prevent his being taken when the pole swept into the air above the people s heads and the man s saddle was empty in an instant Then he and Hugh turned and fled the crowd opening to let them pass and closing up again so quickly that there was no clue to the course they had taken Panting for breath hot dusty and exhausted with fatigue they reached the riverside in safety and getting into a boat with all despatch were soon out of any immediate danger As they glided down the river they plainly heard the people cheering and supposing they might have forced the soldiers to retreat lay upon their oars for a few minutes uncertain whether to return or not But the crowd passing along Westminster Bridge soon assured them that the populace were dispersing and Hugh rightly guessed from this that they had cheered the magistrate for offering to dismiss the military on condition of their immediate departure to their several homes and that he and Barnaby were better where they were He advised therefore that they should proceed to Blackfriars and going ashore at the bridge make the best of their way to The Boot where there was not only good entertainment and safe lodging but where they would certainly be joined by many of their late companions Barnaby assenting they decided on this course of action and pulled for Blackfriars accordingly They landed at a critical time and fortunately for themselves at the right moment For coming into Fleet Street they found it in an unusual stir and inquiring the cause were told that a body of Horse Guards had just galloped past and that they were escorting some rioters whom they had made prisoners to Newgate for safety Not at all ill pleased to have so narrowly escaped the cavalcade they lost no more time in asking questions but hurried to The Boot with as much speed as Hugh considered it prudent to make without appearing singular or attracting an inconvenient share of public notice Chapter 50 They were among the first to reach the tavern but they had not been there many minutes when several groups of men who had formed part of the crowd came straggling in Among them were Simon Tappertit and Mr Dennis both of whom but especially the latter greeted Barnaby with the utmost warmth and paid him many compliments on the prowess he had shown Which said Dennis with an oath as he rested his bludgeon in a corner with his hat upon it and took his seat at the same table with them it does me good to think of There was a opportunity But it led to nothing For my part I don t know what would There s no spirit among the people in these here times Bring something to eat and drink here I m disgusted with humanity On what account asked Mr Tappertit who had been quenching his fiery face in a half gallon can Don t you consider this a good beginning mister Give me security that it an t a ending rejoined the hangman When that soldier went down we might have made London ours but no we stand and gape and look on the justice I wish he had had a bullet in each eye as he would have had if we d gone to work my way says My lads if you ll give me your word to disperse I ll order off the military our people sets up a hurrah throws up the game with the winning cards in their hands and skulks away like a pack of tame curs as they are Ah said the hangman in a tone of deep disgust it makes me blush for my feller creeturs I wish I had been born a ox I do You d have been quite as agreeable a character if you had been I think returned Simon Tappertit going out in a lofty manner Don t be too sure of that rejoined the hangman calling after him if I was a horned animal at the present moment with the smallest grain of sense I d toss every man in this company excepting them two meaning Hugh and Barnaby for his manner of conducting himself this day With which mournful review of their proceedings Mr Dennis sought consolation in cold boiled beef and beer but without at all relaxing the grim and dissatisfied expression of his face the gloom of which was rather deepened than dissipated by their grateful influence The company who were thus libelled might have retaliated by strong words if not by blows but they were dispirited and worn out The greater part of them had fasted since morning all had suffered extremely from the excessive heat and between the day s shouting exertion and excitement many had quite lost their voices and so much of their strength that they could hardly stand Then they were uncertain what to do next fearful of the consequences of what they had done already and sensible that after all they had carried no point but had indeed left matters worse than they had found them Of those who had come to The Boot many dropped off within an hour such of them as were really honest and sincere never after the morning s experience to return or to hold any communication with their late companions Others remained but to refresh themselves and then went home desponding others who had theretofore been regular in their attendance avoided the place altogether The half dozen prisoners whom the Guards had taken were magnified by report into half a hundred at least and their friends being faint and sober so slackened in their energy and so drooped beneath these dispiriting influences that by eight o clock in the evening Dennis Hugh and Barnaby were left alone Even they were fast asleep upon the benches when Gashford s entrance roused them Oh you ARE here then said the Secretary Dear me Why where should we be Muster Gashford Dennis rejoined as he rose into a sitting posture Oh nowhere nowhere he returned with excessive mildness The streets are filled with blue cockades I rather thought you might have been among them I am glad you are not You have orders for us master then said Hugh Oh dear no Not I No orders my good fellow What orders should I have You are not in my service Muster Gashford remonstrated Dennis we belong to the cause don t we The cause repeated the secretary looking at him in a sort of abstraction There is no cause The cause is lost Lost Oh yes You have heard I suppose The petition is rejected by a hundred and ninety two to six It s quite final We might have spared ourselves some trouble That and my lord s vexation are the only circumstances I regret I am quite satisfied in all other respects As he said this he took a penknife from his pocket and putting his hat upon his knee began to busy himself in ripping off the blue cockade which he had worn all day at the same time humming a psalm tune which had been very popular in the morning and dwelling on it with a gentle regret His two adherents looked at each other and at him as if they were at a loss how to pursue the subject At length Hugh after some elbowing and winking between himself and Mr Dennis ventured to stay his hand and to ask him why he meddled with that riband in his hat Because said the secretary looking up with something between a snarl and a smile because to sit still and wear it or to fall asleep and wear it is a mockery That s all friend What would you have us do master cried Hugh Nothing returned Gashford shrugging his shoulders nothing When my lord was reproached and threatened for standing by you I as a prudent man would have had you do nothing When the soldiers were trampling you under their horses feet I would have had you do nothing When one of them was struck down by a daring hand and I saw confusion and dismay in all their faces I would have had you do nothing just what you did in short This is the young man who had so little prudence and so much boldness Ah I am sorry for him Sorry master cried Hugh Sorry Muster Gashford echoed Dennis In case there should be a proclamation out to morrow offering five hundred pounds or some such trifle for his apprehension and in case it should include another man who dropped into the lobby from the stairs above said Gashford coldly still do nothing Fire and fury master cried Hugh starting up What have we done that you should talk to us like this Nothing returned Gashford with a sneer If you are cast into prison if the young man here he looked hard at Barnaby s attentive face is dragged from us and from his friends perhaps from people whom he loves and whom his death would kill is thrown into jail brought out and hanged before their eyes still do nothing You ll find it your best policy I have no doubt Come on cried Hugh striding towards the door Dennis Barnaby come on Where To do what said Gashford slipping past him and standing with his back against it Anywhere Anything cried Hugh Stand aside master or the window will serve our turn as well Let us out Ha ha ha You are of such of such an impetuous nature said Gashford changing his manner for one of the utmost good fellowship and the pleasantest raillery you are such an excitable creature but you ll drink with me before you go Oh yes certainly growled Dennis drawing his sleeve across his thirsty lips No malice brother Drink with Muster Gashford Hugh wiped his heated brow and relaxed into a smile The artful secretary laughed outright Some liquor here Be quick or he ll not stop even for that He is a man of such desperate ardour said the smooth secretary whom Mr Dennis corroborated with sundry nods and muttered oaths Once roused he is a fellow of such fierce determination Hugh poised his sturdy arm aloft and clapping Barnaby on the back bade him fear nothing They shook hands together poor Barnaby evidently possessed with the idea that he was among the most virtuous and disinterested heroes in the world and Gashford laughed again I hear he said smoothly as he stood among them with a great measure of liquor in his hand and filled their glasses as quickly and as often as they chose I hear but I cannot say whether it be true or false that the men who are loitering in the streets to night are half disposed to pull down a Romish chapel or two and that they only want leaders I even heard mention of those in Duke Street Lincoln s Inn Fields and in Warwick Street Golden Square but common report you know You are not going To do nothing rnaster eh cried Hugh No jails and halter for Barnaby and me They must be frightened out of that Leaders are wanted are they Now boys A most impetuous fellow cried the secretary Ha ha A courageous boisterous most vehement fellow A man who There was no need to finish the sentence for they had rushed out of the house and were far beyond hearing He stopped in the middle of a laugh listened drew on his gloves and clasping his hands behind him paced the deserted room for a long time then bent his steps towards the busy town and walked into the streets They were filled with people for the rumour of that day s proceedings had made a great noise Those persons who did not care to leave home were at their doors or windows and one topic of discourse prevailed on every side Some reported that the riots were effectually put down others that they had broken out again some said that Lord George Gordon had been sent under a strong guard to the Tower others that an attempt had been made upon the King s life that the soldiers had been again called out and that the noise of musketry in a distant part of the town had been plainly heard within an hour As it grew darker these stories became more direful and mysterious and often when some frightened passenger ran past with tidings that the rioters were not far off and were coming up the doors were shut and barred lower windows made secure and as much consternation engendered as if the city were invaded by a foreign army Gashford walked stealthily about listening to all he heard and diffusing or confirming whenever he had an opportunity such false intelligence as suited his own purpose and busily occupied in this way turned into Holborn for the twentieth time when a great many women and children came flying along the street often panting and looking back and the confused murmur of numerous voices struck upon his ear Assured by these tokens and by the red light which began to flash upon the houses on either side that some of his friends were indeed approaching he begged a moment s shelter at a door which opened as he passed and running with some other persons to an upper window looked out upon the crowd They had torches among them and the chief faces were distinctly visible That they had been engaged in the destruction of some building was sufficiently apparent and that it was a Catholic place of worship was evident from the spoils they bore as trophies which were easily recognisable for the vestments of priests and rich fragments of altar furniture Covered with soot and dirt and dust and lime their garments torn to rags their hair hanging wildly about them their hands and faces jagged and bleeding with the wounds of rusty nails Barnaby Hugh and Dennis hurried on before them all like hideous madmen After them the dense throng came fighting on some singing some shouting in triumph some quarrelling among themselves some menacing the spectators as they passed some with great wooden fragments on which they spent their rage as if they had been alive rending them limb from limb and hurling the scattered morsels high into the air some in a drunken state unconscious of the hurts they had received from falling bricks and stones and beams one borne upon a shutter in the very midst covered with a dingy cloth a senseless ghastly heap Thus a vision of coarse faces with here and there a blot of flaring smoky light a dream of demon heads and savage eyes and sticks and iron bars uplifted in the air and whirled about a bewildering horror in which so much was seen and yet so little which seemed so long and yet so short in which there were so many phantoms not to be forgotten all through life and yet so many things that could not be observed in one distracting glimpse it flitted onward and was gone As it passed away upon its work of wrath and ruin a piercing scream was heard A knot of persons ran towards the spot Gashford who just then emerged into the street among them He was on the outskirts of the little concourse and could not see or hear what passed within but one who had a better place informed him that a widow woman had descried her son among the rioters Is that all said the secretary turning his face homewards Well I think this looks a little more like business Chapter 51 Promising as these outrages were to Gashford s view and much like business as they looked they extended that night no farther The soldiers were again called out again they took half a dozen prisoners and again the crowd dispersed after a short and bloodless scuffle Hot and drunken though they were they had not yet broken all bounds and set all law and government at defiance Something of their habitual deference to the authority erected by society for its own preservation yet remained among them and had its majesty been vindicated in time the secretary would have had to digest a bitter disappointment By midnight the streets were clear and quiet and save that there stood in two parts of the town a heap of nodding walls and pile of rubbish where there had been at sunset a rich and handsome building everything wore its usual aspect Even the Catholic gentry and tradesmen of whom there were many resident in different parts of the City and its suburbs had no fear for their lives or property and but little indignation for the wrong they had already sustained in the plunder and destruction of their temples of worship An honest confidence in the government under whose protection they had lived for many years and a well founded reliance on the good feeling and right thinking of the great mass of the community with whom notwithstanding their religious differences they were every day in habits of confidential affectionate and friendly intercourse reassured them even under the excesses that had been committed and convinced them that they who were Protestants in anything but the name were no more to be considered as abettors of these disgraceful occurrences than they themselves were chargeable with the uses of the block the rack the gibbet and the stake in cruel Mary s reign The clock was on the stroke of one when Gabriel Varden with his lady and Miss Miggs sat waiting in the little parlour This fact the toppling wicks of the dull wasted candles the silence that prevailed and above all the nightcaps of both maid and matron were sufficient evidence that they had been prepared for bed some time ago and had some reason for sitting up so far beyond their usual hour If any other corroborative testimony had been required it would have been abundantly furnished in the actions of Miss Miggs who having arrived at that restless state and sensitive condition of the nervous system which are the result of long watching did by a constant rubbing and tweaking of her nose a perpetual change of position arising from the sudden growth of imaginary knots and knobs in her chair a frequent friction of her eyebrows the incessant recurrence of a small cough a small groan a gasp a sigh a sniff a spasmodic start and by other demonstrations of that nature so file down and rasp as it were the patience of the locksmith that after looking at her in silence for some time he at last broke out into this apostrophe Miggs my good girl go to bed do go to bed You re really worse than the dripping of a hundred water butts outside the window or the scratching of as many mice behind the wainscot I can t bear it Do go to bed Miggs To oblige me do You haven t got nothing to untie sir returned Miss Miggs and therefore your requests does not surprise me But missis has and while you sit up mim she added turning to the locksmith s wife I couldn t no not if twenty times the quantity of cold water was aperiently running down my back at this moment go to bed with a quiet spirit Having spoken these words Miss Miggs made divers efforts to rub her shoulders in an impossible place and shivered from head to foot thereby giving the beholders to understand that the imaginary cascade was still in full flow but that a sense of duty upheld her under that and all other sufferings and nerved her to endurance Mrs Varden being too sleepy to speak and Miss Miggs having as the phrase is said her say the locksmith had nothing for it but to sigh and be as quiet as he could But to be quiet with such a basilisk before him was impossible If he looked another way it was worse to feel that she was rubbing her cheek or twitching her ear or winking her eye or making all kinds of extraordinary shapes with her nose than to see her do it If she was for a moment free from any of these complaints it was only because of her foot being asleep or of her arm having got the fidgets or of her leg being doubled up with the cramp or of some other horrible disorder which racked her whole frame If she did enjoy a moment s ease then with her eyes shut and her mouth wide open she would be seen to sit very stiff and upright in her chair then to nod a little way forward and stop with a jerk then to nod a little farther forward and stop with another jerk then to recover herself then to come forward again lower lower lower by very slow degrees until just as it seemed impossible that she could preserve her balance for another instant and the locksmith was about to call out in an agony to save her from dashing down upon her forehead and fracturing her skull then all of a sudden and without the smallest notice she would come upright and rigid again with her eyes open and in her countenance an expression of defiance sleepy but yet most obstinate which plainly said I ve never once closed em since I looked at you last and I ll take my oath of it At length after the clock had struck two there was a sound at the street door as if somebody had fallen against the knocker by accident Miss Miggs immediately jumping up and clapping her hands cried with a drowsy mingling of the sacred and profane Ally Looyer mim there s Simmuns s knock Who s there said Gabriel Me cried the well known voice of Mr Tappertit Gabriel opened the door and gave him admission He did not cut a very insinuating figure for a man of his stature suffers in a crowd and having been active in yesterday morning s work his dress was literally crushed from head to foot his hat being beaten out of all shape and his shoes trodden down at heel like slippers His coat fluttered in strips about him the buckles were torn away both from his knees and feet half his neckerchief was gone and the bosom of his shirt was rent to tatters Yet notwithstanding all these personal disadvantages despite his being very weak from heat and fatigue and so begrimed with mud and dust that he might have been in a case for anything of the real texture either of his skin or apparel that the eye could discern he stalked haughtily into the parlour and throwing himself into a chair and endeavouring to thrust his hands into the pockets of his small clothes which were turned inside out and displayed upon his legs like tassels surveyed the household with a gloomy dignity Simon said the locksmith gravely how comes it that you return home at this time of night and in this condition Give me an assurance that you have not been among the rioters and I am satisfied Sir replied Mr Tappertit with a contemptuous look I wonder at YOUR assurance in making such demands You have been drinking said the locksmith As a general principle and in the most offensive sense of the words sir returned his journeyman with great self possession I consider you a liar In that last observation you have unintentionally unintentionally sir struck upon the truth Martha said the locksmith turning to his wife and shaking his head sorrowfully while a smile at the absurd figure beside him still played upon his open face I trust it may turn out that this poor lad is not the victim of the knaves and fools we have so often had words about and who have done so much harm to day If he has been at Warwick Street or Duke Street to night He has been at neither sir cried Mr Tappertit in a loud voice which he suddenly dropped into a whisper as he repeated with eyes fixed upon the locksmith he has been at neither I am glad of it with all my heart said the locksmith in a serious tone for if he had been and it could be proved against him Martha your Great Association would have been to him the cart that draws men to the gallows and leaves them hanging in the air It would as sure as we re alive Mrs Varden was too much scared by Simon s altered manner and appearance and by the accounts of the rioters which had reached her ears that night to offer any retort or to have recourse to her usual matrimonial policy Miss Miggs wrung her hands and wept He was not at Duke Street or at Warwick Street G Varden said Simon sternly but he WAS at Westminster Perhaps sir he kicked a county member perhaps sir he tapped a lord you may stare sir I repeat it blood flowed from noses and perhaps he tapped a lord Who knows This he added putting his hand into his waistcoat pocket and taking out a large tooth at the sight of which both Miggs and Mrs Varden screamed this was a bishop s Beware G Varden Now I would rather said the locksmith hastily have paid five hundred pounds than had this come to pass You idiot do you know what peril you stand in I know it sir replied his journeyman and it is my glory I was there everybody saw me there I was conspicuous and prominent I will abide the consequences The locksmith really disturbed and agitated paced to and fro in silence glancing at his former prentice every now and then and at length stopping before him said Get to bed and sleep for a couple of hours that you may wake penitent and with some of your senses about you Be sorry for what you have done and we will try to save you If I call him by five o clock said Varden turning hurriedly to his wife and he washes himself clean and changes his dress he may get to the Tower Stairs and away by the Gravesend tide boat before any search is made for him From there he can easily get on to Canterbury where your cousin will give him work till this storm has blown over I am not sure that I do right in screening him from the punishment he deserves but he has lived in this house man and boy for a dozen years and I should be sorry if for this one day s work he made a miserable end Lock the front door Miggs and show no light towards the street when you go upstairs Quick Simon Get to bed And do you suppose sir retorted Mr Tappertit with a thickness and slowness of speech which contrasted forcibly with the rapidity and earnestness of his kind hearted master and do you suppose sir that I am base and mean enough to accept your servile proposition Miscreant Whatever you please Sim but get to bed Every minute is of consequence The light here Miggs Yes yes oh do Go to bed directly cried the two women together Mr Tappertit stood upon his feet and pushing his chair away to show that he needed no assistance answered swaying himself to and fro and managing his head as if it had no connection whatever with his body You spoke of Miggs sir Miggs may be smothered Oh Simmun ejaculated that young lady in a faint voice Oh mim Oh sir Oh goodness gracious what a turn he has give me This family may ALL be smothered sir returned Mr Tappertit after glancing at her with a smile of ineffable disdain excepting Mrs V I have come here sir for her sake this night Mrs Varden take this piece of paper It s a protection ma am You may need it With these words he held out at arm s length a dirty crumpled scrap of writing The locksmith took it from him opened it and read as follows All good friends to our cause I hope will be particular and do no injury to the property of any true Protestant I am well assured that the proprietor of this house is a staunch and worthy friend to the cause GEORGE GORDON What s this said the locksmith with an altered face Something that ll do you good service young feller replied his journeyman as you ll find Keep that safe and where you can lay your hand upon it in an instant And chalk No Popery on your door to morrow night and for a week to come that s all This is a genuine document said the locksmith I know for I have seen the hand before What threat does it imply What devil is abroad A fiery devil retorted Sim a flaming furious devil Don t you put yourself in its way or you re done for my buck Be warned in time G Varden Farewell But here the two women threw themselves in his way especially Miss Miggs who fell upon him with such fervour that she pinned him against the wall and conjured him in moving words not to go forth till he was sober to listen to reason to think of it to take some rest and then determine I tell you said Mr Tappertit that my mind is made up My bleeding country calls me and I go Miggs if you don t get out of the way I ll pinch you Miss Miggs still clinging to the rebel screamed once vociferously but whether in the distraction of her mind or because of his having executed his threat is uncertain Release me said Simon struggling to free himself from her chaste but spider like embrace Let me go I have made arrangements for you in an altered state of society and mean to provide for you comfortably in life there Will that satisfy you Oh Simmun cried Miss Miggs Oh my blessed Simmun Oh mim what are my feelings at this conflicting moment Of a rather turbulent description it would seem for her nightcap had been knocked off in the scuffle and she was on her knees upon the floor making a strange revelation of blue and yellow curl papers straggling locks of hair tags of staylaces and strings of it s impossible to say what panting for breath clasping her hands turning her eyes upwards shedding abundance of tears and exhibiting various other symptoms of the acutest mental suffering I leave said Simon turning to his master with an utter disregard of Miggs s maidenly affliction a box of things upstairs Do what you like with em I don t want em I m never coming back here any more Provide yourself sir with a journeyman I m my country s journeyman henceforward that s MY line of business Be what you like in two hours time but now go up to bed returned the locksmith planting himself in the doorway Do you hear me Go to bed I hear you and defy you Varden rejoined Simon Tappertit This night sir I have been in the country planning an expedition which shall fill your bell hanging soul with wonder and dismay The plot demands my utmost energy Let me pass I ll knock you down if you come near the door replied the locksmith You had better go to bed Simon made no answer but gathering himself up as straight as he could plunged head foremost at his old master and the two went driving out into the workshop together plying their hands and feet so briskly that they looked like half a dozen while Miggs and Mrs Varden screamed for twelve It would have been easy for Varden to knock his old prentice down and bind him hand and foot but as he was loth to hurt him in his then defenceless state he contented himself with parrying his blows when he could taking them in perfect good part when he could not and keeping between him and the door until a favourable opportunity should present itself for forcing him to retreat up stairs and shutting him up in his own room But in the goodness of his heart he calculated too much upon his adversary s weakness and forgot that drunken men who have lost the power of walking steadily can often run Watching his time Simon Tappertit made a cunning show of falling back staggered unexpectedly forward brushed past him opened the door he knew the trick of that lock well and darted down the street like a mad dog The locksmith paused for a moment in the excess of his astonishment and then gave chase It was an excellent season for a run for at that silent hour the streets were deserted the air was cool and the flying figure before him distinctly visible at a great distance as it sped away with a long gaunt shadow following at its heels But the short winded locksmith had no chance against a man of Sim s youth and spare figure though the day had been when he could have run him down in no time The space between them rapidly increased and as the rays of the rising sun streamed upon Simon in the act of turning a distant corner Gabriel Varden was fain to give up and sit down on a doorstep to fetch his breath Simon meanwhile without once stopping fled at the same degree of swiftness to The Boot where as he well knew some of his company were lying and at which respectable hostelry for he had already acquired the distinction of being in great peril of the law a friendly watch had been expecting him all night and was even now on the look out for his coming Go thy ways Sim go thy ways said the locksmith as soon as he could speak I have done my best for thee poor lad and would have saved thee but the rope is round thy neck I fear So saying and shaking his head in a very sorrowful and disconsolate manner he turned back and soon re entered his own house where Mrs Varden and the faithful Miggs had been anxiously expecting his return Now Mrs Varden and by consequence Miss Miggs likewise was impressed with a secret misgiving that she had done wrong that she had to the utmost of her small means aided and abetted the growth of disturbances the end of which it was impossible to foresee that she had led remotely to the scene which had just passed and that the locksmith s time for triumph and reproach had now arrived indeed And so strongly did Mrs Varden feel this and so crestfallen was she in consequence that while her husband was pursuing their lost journeyman she secreted under her chair the little red brick dwelling house with the yellow roof lest it should furnish new occasion for reference to the painful theme and now hid the same still more with the skirts of her dress But it happened that the locksmith had been thinking of this very article on his way home and that coming into the room and not seeing it he at once demanded where it was Mrs Varden had no resource but to produce it which she did with many tears and broken protestations that if she could have known Yes yes said Varden of course I know that I don t mean to reproach you my dear But recollect from this time that all good things perverted to evil purposes are worse than those which are naturally bad A thoroughly wicked woman is wicked indeed When religion goes wrong she is very wrong for the same reason Let us say no more about it my dear So he dropped the red brick dwelling house on the floor and setting his heel upon it crushed it into pieces The halfpence and sixpences and other voluntary contributions rolled about in all directions but nobody offered to touch them or to take them up That said the locksmith is easily disposed of and I would to Heaven that everything growing out of the same society could be settled as easily It happens very fortunately Varden said his wife with her handkerchief to her eyes that in case any more disturbances should happen which I hope not I sincerely hope not I hope so too my dear That in case any should occur we have the piece of paper which that poor misguided young man brought Ay to be sure said the locksmith turning quickly round Where is that piece of paper Mrs Varden stood aghast as he took it from her outstretched band tore it into fragments and threw them under the grate Not use it she said Use it cried the locksmith No Let them come and pull the roof about our ears let them burn us out of house and home I d neither have the protection of their leader nor chalk their howl upon my door though for not doing it they shot me on my own threshold Use it Let them come and do their worst The first man who crosses my doorstep on such an errand as theirs had better be a hundred miles away Let him look to it The others may have their will I wouldn t beg or buy them off if instead of every pound of iron in the place there was a hundred weight of gold Get you to bed Martha I shall take down the shutters and go to work So early said his wife Ay replied the locksmith cheerily so early Come when they may they shall not find us skulking and hiding as if we feared to take our portion of the light of day and left it all to them So pleasant dreams to you my dear and cheerful sleep With that he gave his wife a hearty kiss and bade her delay no longer or it would be time to rise before she lay down to rest Mrs Varden quite amiably and meekly walked upstairs followed by Miggs who although a good deal subdued could not refrain from sundry stimulative coughs and sniffs by the way or from holding up her hands in astonishment at the daring conduct of master Chapter 52 A mob is usually a creature of very mysterious existence particularly in a large city Where it comes from or whither it goes few men can tell Assembling and dispersing with equal suddenness it is as difficult to follow to its various sources as the sea itself nor does the parallel stop here for the ocean is not more fickle and uncertain more terrible when roused more unreasonable or more cruel The people who were boisterous at Westminster upon the Friday morning and were eagerly bent upon the work of devastation in Duke Street and Warwick Street at night were in the mass the same Allowing for the chance accessions of which any crowd is morally sure in a town where there must always be a large number of idle and profligate persons one and the same mob was at both places Yet they spread themselves in various directions when they dispersed in the afternoon made no appointment for reassembling had no definite purpose or design and indeed for anything they knew were scattered beyond the hope of future union At The Boot which as has been shown was in a manner the head quarters of the rioters there were not upon this Friday night a dozen people Some slept in the stable and outhouses some in the common room some two or three in beds The rest were in their usual homes or haunts Perhaps not a score in all lay in the adjacent fields and lanes and under haystacks or near the warmth of brick kilns who had not their accustomed place of rest beneath the open sky As to the public ways within the town they had their ordinary nightly occupants and no others the usual amount of vice and wretchedness but no more The experience of one evening however had taught the reckless leaders of disturbance that they had but to show themselves in the streets to be immediately surrounded by materials which they could only have kept together when their aid was not required at great risk expense and trouble Once possessed of this secret they were as confident as if twenty thousand men devoted to their will had been encamped about them and assumed a confidence which could not have been surpassed though that had really been the case All day Saturday they remained quiet On Sunday they rather studied how to keep their men within call and in full hope than to follow out by any fierce measure their first day s proceedings I hope said Dennis as with a loud yawn he raised his body from a heap of straw on which he had been sleeping and supporting his head upon his hand appealed to Hugh on Sunday morning that Muster Gashford allows some rest Perhaps he d have us at work again already eh It s not his way to let matters drop you may be sure of that growled Hugh in answer I m in no humour to stir yet though I m as stiff as a dead body and as full of ugly scratches as if I had been fighting all day yesterday with wild cats You ve so much enthusiasm that s it said Dennis looking with great admiration at the uncombed head matted beard and torn hands and face of the wild figure before him you re such a devil of a fellow You hurt yourself a hundred times more than you need because you will be foremost in everything and will do more than the rest For the matter of that returned Hugh shaking back his ragged hair and glancing towards the door of the stable in which they lay there s one yonder as good as me What did I tell you about him Did I say he was worth a dozen when you doubted him Mr Dennis rolled lazily over upon his breast and resting his chin upon his hand in imitation of the attitude in which Hugh lay said as he too looked towards the door Ay ay you knew him brother you knew him But who d suppose to look at that chap now that he could be the man he is Isn t it a thousand cruel pities brother that instead of taking his nat ral rest and qualifying himself for further exertions in this here honourable cause he should be playing at soldiers like a boy And his cleanliness too said Mr Dennis who certainly had no reason to entertain a fellow feeling with anybody who was particular on that score what weaknesses he s guilty of with respect to his cleanliness At five o clock this morning there he was at the pump though any one would think he had gone through enough the day before yesterday to be pretty fast asleep at that time But no when I woke for a minute or two there he was at the pump and if you d seen him sticking them peacock s feathers into his hat when he d done washing ah I m sorry he s such a imperfect character but the best on us is incomplete in some pint of view or another The subject of this dialogue and of these concluding remarks which were uttered in a tone of philosophical meditation was as the reader will have divined no other than Barnaby who with his flag in hand stood sentry in the little patch of sunlight at the distant door or walked to and fro outside singing softly to himself and keeping time to the music of some clear church bells Whether he stood still leaning with both hands on the flagstaff or bearing it upon his shoulder paced slowly up and down the careful arrangement of his poor dress and his erect and lofty bearing showed how high a sense he had of the great importance of his trust and how happy and how proud it made him To Hugh and his companion who lay in a dark corner of the gloomy shed he and the sunlight and the peaceful Sabbath sound to which he made response seemed like a bright picture framed by the door and set off by the stable s blackness The whole formed such a contrast to themselves as they lay wallowing like some obscene animals in their squalor and wickedness on the two heaps of straw that for a few moments they looked on without speaking and felt almost ashamed Ah said Hugh at length carrying it off with a laugh He s a rare fellow is Barnaby and can do more with less rest or meat or drink than any of us As to his soldiering I put him on duty there Then there was a object in it and a proper good one too I ll be sworn retorted Dennis with a broad grin and an oath of the same quality What was it brother Why you see said Hugh crawling a little nearer to him that our noble captain yonder came in yesterday morning rather the worse for liquor and was like you and me ditto last night Dennis looked to where Simon Tappertit lay coiled upon a truss of hay snoring profoundly and nodded And our noble captain continued Hugh with another laugh our noble captain and I have planned for to morrow a roaring expedition with good profit in it Again the Papists asked Dennis rubbing his hands Ay against the Papists against one of em at least that some of us and I for one owe a good heavy grudge to Not Muster Gashford s friend that he spoke to us about in my house eh said Dennis brimfull of pleasant expectation The same man said Hugh That s your sort cried Mr Dennis gaily shaking hands with him that s the kind of game Let s have revenges and injuries and all that and we shall get on twice as fast Now you talk indeed Ha ha ha The captain added Hugh has thoughts of carrying off a woman in the bustle and ha ha ha and so have I Mr Dennis received this part of the scheme with a wry face observing that as a general principle he objected to women altogether as being unsafe and slippery persons on whom there was no calculating with any certainty and who were never in the same mind for four and twenty hours at a stretch He might have expatiated on this suggestive theme at much greater length but that it occurred to him to ask what connection existed between the proposed expedition and Barnaby s being posted at the stable door as sentry to which Hugh cautiously replied in these words Why the people we mean to visit were friends of his once upon a time and I know that much of him to feel pretty sure that if he thought we were going to do them any harm he d be no friend to our side but would lend a ready hand to the other So I ve persuaded him for I know him of old that Lord George has picked him out to guard this place to morrow while we re away and that it s a great honour and so he s on duty now and as proud of it as if he was a general Ha ha What do you say to me for a careful man as well as a devil of a one Mr Dennis exhausted himself in compliments and then added But about the expedition itself About that said Hugh you shall hear all particulars from me and the great captain conjointly and both together for see he s waking up Rouse yourself lion heart Ha ha Put a good face upon it and drink again Another hair of the dog that bit you captain Call for drink There s enough of gold and silver cups and candlesticks buried underneath my bed he added rolling back the straw and pointing to where the ground was newly turned to pay for it if it was a score of casks full Drink captain Mr Tappertit received these jovial promptings with a very bad grace being much the worse both in mind and body for his two nights of debauch and but indifferently able to stand upon his legs With Hugh s assistance however he contrived to stagger to the pump and having refreshed himself with an abundant draught of cold water and a copious shower of the same refreshing liquid on his head and face he ordered some rum and milk to be served and upon that innocent beverage and some biscuits and cheese made a pretty hearty meal That done he disposed himself in an easy attitude on the ground beside his two companions who were carousing after their own tastes and proceeded to enlighten Mr Dennis in reference to to morrow s project That their conversation was an interesting one was rendered manifest by its length and by the close attention of all three That it was not of an oppressively grave character but was enlivened by various pleasantries arising out of the subject was clear from their loud and frequent roars of laughter which startled Barnaby on his post and made him wonder at their levity But he was not summoned to join them until they had eaten and drunk and slept and talked together for some hours not indeed until the twilight when they informed him that they were about to make a slight demonstration in the streets just to keep the people s hands in as it was Sunday night and the public might otherwise be disappointed and that he was free to accompany them if he would Without the slightest preparation saving that they carried clubs and wore the blue cockade they sallied out into the streets and with no more settled design than that of doing as much mischief as they could paraded them at random Their numbers rapidly increasing they soon divided into parties and agreeing to meet by and by in the fields near Welbeck Street scoured the town in various directions The largest body and that which augmented with the greatest rapidity was the one to which Hugh and Barnaby belonged This took its way towards Moorfields where there was a rich chapel and in which neighbourhood several Catholic families were known to reside Beginning with the private houses so occupied they broke open the doors and windows and while they destroyed the furniture and left but the bare walls made a sharp search for tools and engines of destruction such as hammers pokers axes saws and such like instruments Many of the rioters made belts of cord of handkerchiefs or any material they found at hand and wore these weapons as openly as pioneers upon a field day There was not the least disguise or concealment indeed on this night very little excitement or hurry From the chapels they tore down and took away the very altars benches pulpits pews and flooring from the dwelling houses the very wainscoting and stairs This Sunday evening s recreation they pursued like mere workmen who had a certain task to do and did it Fifty resolute men might have turned them at any moment a single company of soldiers could have scattered them like dust but no man interposed no authority restrained them and except by the terrified persons who fled from their approach they were as little heeded as if they were pursuing their lawful occupations with the utmost sobriety and good conduct In the same manner they marched to the place of rendezvous agreed upon made great fires in the fields and reserving the most valuable of their spoils burnt the rest Priestly garments images of saints rich stuffs and ornaments altar furniture and household goods were cast into the flames and shed a glare on the whole country round but they danced and howled and roared about these fires till they were tired and were never for an instant checked As the main body filed off from this scene of action and passed down Welbeck Street they came upon Gashford who had been a witness of their proceedings and was walking stealthily along the pavement Keeping up with him and yet not seeming to speak Hugh muttered in his ear Is this better master No said Gashford It is not What would you have said Hugh Fevers are never at their height at once They must get on by degrees I would have you said Gashford pinching his arm with such malevolence that his nails seemed to meet in the skin I would have you put some meaning into your work Fools Can you make no better bonfires than of rags and scraps Can you burn nothing whole A little patience master said Hugh Wait but a few hours and you shall see Look for a redness in the sky to morrow night With that he fell back into his place beside Barnaby and when the secretary looked after him both were lost in the crowd Chapter 53 The next day was ushered in by merry peals of bells and by the firing of the Tower guns flags were hoisted on many of the church steeples the usual demonstrations were made in honour of the anniversary of the King s birthday and every man went about his pleasure or business as if the city were in perfect order and there were no half smouldering embers in its secret places which on the approach of night would kindle up again and scatter ruin and dismay abroad The leaders of the riot rendered still more daring by the success of last night and by the booty they had acquired kept steadily together and only thought of implicating the mass of their followers so deeply that no hope of pardon or reward might tempt them to betray their more notorious confederates into the hands of justice Indeed the sense of having gone too far to be forgiven held the timid together no less than the bold Many who would readily have pointed out the foremost rioters and given evidence against them felt that escape by that means was hopeless when their every act had been observed by scores of people who had taken no part in the disturbances who had suffered in their persons peace or property by the outrages of the mob who would be most willing witnesses and whom the government would no doubt prefer to any King s evidence that might be offered Many of this class had deserted their usual occupations on the Saturday morning some had been seen by their employers active in the tumult others knew they must be suspected and that they would be discharged if they returned others had been desperate from the beginning and comforted themselves with the homely proverb that being hanged at all they might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb They all hoped and believed in a greater or less degree that the government they seemed to have paralysed would in its terror come to terms with them in the end and suffer them to make their own conditions The least sanguine among them reasoned with himself that at the worst they were too many to be all punished and that he had as good a chance of escape as any other man The great mass never reasoned or thought at all but were stimulated by their own headlong passions by poverty by ignorance by the love of mischief and the hope of plunder One other circumstance is worthy of remark and that is that from the moment of their first outbreak at Westminster every symptom of order or preconcerted arrangement among them vanished When they divided into parties and ran to different quarters of the town it was on the spontaneous suggestion of the moment Each party swelled as it went along like rivers as they roll towards the sea new leaders sprang up as they were wanted disappeared when the necessity was over and reappeared at the next crisis Each tumult took shape and form from the circumstances of the moment sober workmen going home from their day s labour were seen to cast down their baskets of tools and become rioters in an instant mere boys on errands did the like In a word a moral plague ran through the city The noise and hurry and excitement had for hundreds and hundreds an attraction they had no firmness to resist The contagion spread like a dread fever an infectious madness as yet not near its height seized on new victims every hour and society began to tremble at their ravings It was between two and three o clock in the afternoon when Gashford looked into the lair described in the last chapter and seeing only Barnaby and Dennis there inquired for Hugh He was out Barnaby told him had gone out more than an hour ago and had not yet returned Dennis said the smiling secretary in his smoothest voice as he sat down cross legged on a barrel Dennis The hangman struggled into a sitting posture directly and with his eyes wide open looked towards him How do you do Dennis said Gashford nodding I hope you have suffered no inconvenience from your late exertions Dennis I always will say of you Muster Gashford returned the hangman staring at him that that ere quiet way of yours might almost wake a dead man It is he added with a muttered oath still staring at him in a thoughtful manner so awful sly So distinct eh Dennis Distinct he answered scratching his head and keeping his eyes upon the secretary s face I seem to hear it Muster Gashford in my wery bones I am very glad your sense of hearing is so sharp and that I succeed in making myself so intelligible said Gashford in his unvarying even tone Where is your friend Mr Dennis looked round as in expectation of beholding him asleep upon his bed of straw then remembering he had seen him go out replied I can t say where he is Muster Gashford I expected him back afore now I hope it isn t time that we was busy Muster Gashford Nay said the secretary who should know that as well as you How can I tell you Dennis You are perfect master of your own actions you know and accountable to nobody except sometimes to the law eh Dennis who was very much baffled by the cool matter of course manner of this reply recovered his self possession on his professional pursuits being referred to and pointing towards Barnaby shook his head and frowned Hush cried Barnaby Ah Do hush about that Muster Gashford said the hangman in a low voice pop lar prejudices you always forget well Barnaby my lad what s the matter I hear him coming he answered Hark Do you mark that That s his foot Bless you I know his step and his dog s too Tramp tramp pit pat on they come together and ha ha ha and here they are he cried joyfully welcoming Hugh with both hands and then patting him fondly on the back as if instead of being the rough companion he was he had been one of the most prepossessing of men Here he is and safe too I am glad to see him back again old Hugh I m a Turk if he don t give me a warmer welcome always than any man of sense said Hugh shaking hands with him with a kind of ferocious friendship strange enough to see How are you boy Hearty cried Barnaby waving his hat Ha ha ha And merrry too Hugh And ready to do anything for the good cause and the right and to help the kind mild pale faced gentleman the lord they used so ill eh Hugh Ay returned his friend dropping his hand and looking at Gashford for an instant with a changed expression before he spoke to him Good day master And good day to you replied the secretary nursing his leg And many good days whole years of them I hope You are heated So would you have been master said Hugh wiping his face if you d been running here as fast as I have You know the news then Yes I supposed you would have heard it News what news You don t cried Gashford raising his eyebrows with an exclamation of surprise Dear me Come then I AM the first to make you acquainted with your distinguished position after all Do you see the King s Arms a top he smilingly asked as he took a large paper from his pocket unfolded it and held it out for Hugh s inspection Well said Hugh What s that to me Much A great deal replied the secretary Read it I told you the first time I saw you that I couldn t read said Hugh impatiently What in the Devil s name s inside of it It is a proclamation from the King in Council said Gashford dated to day and offering a reward of five hundred pounds five hundred pounds is a great deal of money and a large temptation to some people to any one who will discover the person or persons most active in demolishing those chapels on Saturday night Is that all cried Hugh with an indifferent air I knew of that Truly I might have known you did said Gashford smiling and folding up the document again Your friend I might have guessed indeed I did guess was sure to tell you My friend stammered Hugh with an unsuccessful effort to appear surprised What friend Tut tut do you suppose I don t know where you have been retorted Gashford rubbing his hands and beating the back of one on the palm of the other and looking at him with a cunning eye How dull you think me Shall I say his name No said Hugh with a hasty glance towards Dennis You have also heard from him no doubt resumed the secretary after a moment s pause that the rioters who have been taken poor fellows are committed for trial and that some very active witnesses have had the temerity to appear against them Among others and here he clenched his teeth as if he would suppress by force some violent words that rose upon his tongue and spoke very slowly Among others a gentleman who saw the work going on in Warwick Street a Catholic gentleman one Haredale Hugh would have prevented his uttering the word but it was out already Hearing the name Barnaby turned swiftly round Duty duty bold Barnaby cried Hugh assuming his wildest and most rapid manner and thrusting into his hand his staff and flag which leant against the wall Mount guard without loss of time for we are off upon our expedition Up Dennis and get ready Take care that no one turns the straw upon my bed brave Barnaby we know what s underneath it eh Now master quick What you have to say say speedily for the little captain and a cluster of em are in the fields and only waiting for us Sharp s the word and strike s the action Quick Barnaby was not proof against this bustle and despatch The look of mingled astonishtnent and anger which had appeared in his face when he turned towards them faded from it as the words passed from his memory like breath from a polished mirror and grasping the weapon which Hugh forced upon him he proudly took his station at the door beyond their hearing You might have spoiled our plans master said Hugh YOU too of all men Who would have supposed that HE would be so quick urged Gashford He s as quick sometimes I don t mean with his hands for that you know but with his head as you or any man said Hugh Dennis it s time we were going they re waiting for us I came to tell you Reach me my stick and belt Here Lend a hand master Fling this over my shoulder and buckle it behind will you Brisk as ever said the secretary adjusting it for him as he desired A man need be brisk to day there s brisk work a foot There is is there said Gashford He said it with such a provoking assumption of ignorance that Hugh looking over his shoulder and angrily down upon him replied Is there You know there is Who knows better than you master that the first great step to be taken is to make examples of these witnesses and frighten all men from appearing against us or any of our body any more There s one we know of returned Gashford with an expressive smile who is at least as well informed upon that subject as you or I If we mean the same gentleman as I suppose we do Hugh rejoined softly I tell you this he s as good and quick information about everything as here he paused and looked round as if to make sure that the person in question was not within hearing as Old Nick himself Have you done that master How slow you are It s quite fast now said Gashford rising I say you didn t find that your friend disapproved of to day s little expedition Ha ha ha It is fortunate it jumps so well with the witness policy for once planned it must have been carried out And now you are going eh Now we are going master Hugh replied Any parting words Oh dear no said Gashford sweetly None You re sure cried Hugh nudging the grinning Dennis Quite sure eh Muster Gashford chuckled the hangman Gashford paused a moment struggling with his caution and his malice then putting himself between the two men and laying a hand upon the arm of each said in a cramped whisper Do not my good friends I am sure you will not forget our talk one night in your house Dennis about this person No mercy no quarter no two beams of his house to be left standing where the builder placed them Fire the saying goes is a good servant but a bad master Makes it HIS master he deserves no better But I am sure you will be firm I am sure you will be very resolute I am sure you will remember that he thirsts for your lives and those of all your brave companions If you ever acted like staunch fellows you will do so to day Won t you Dennis won t you Hugh The two looked at him and at each other then bursting into a roar of laughter brandished their staves above their heads shook hands and hurried out When they had been gone a little time Gashford followed They were yet in sight and hastening to that part of the adjacent fields in which their fellows had already mustered Hugh was looking back and flourishing his hat to Barnaby who delighted with his trust replied in the same way and then resumed his pacing up and down before the stable door where his feet had worn a path already And when Gashford himself was far distant and looked back for the last time he was still walking to and fro with the same measured tread the most devoted and the blithest champion that ever maintained a post and felt his heart lifted up with a brave sense of duty and determination to defend it to the last Smiling at the simplicity of the poor idiot Gashford betook himself to Welbeck Street by a different path from that which he knew the rioters would take and sitting down behind a curtain in one of the upper windows of Lord George Gordon s house waited impatiently for their coming They were so long that although he knew it had been settled they should come that way he had a misgiving they must have changed their plans and taken some other route But at length the roar of voices was heard in the neighbouring fields and soon afterwards they came thronging past in a great body However they were not all nor nearly all in one body but were as he soon found divided into four parties each of which stopped before the house to give three cheers and then went on the leaders crying out in what direction they were going and calling on the spectators to join them The first detachment carrying by way of banners some relics of the havoc they had made in Moorfields proclaimed that they were on their way to Chelsea whence they would return in the same order to make of the spoil they bore a great bonfire near at hand The second gave out that they were bound for Wapping to destroy a chapel the third that their place of destination was East Smithfield and their object the same All this was done in broad bright summer day Gay carriages and chairs stopped to let them pass or turned back to avoid them people on foot stood aside in doorways or perhaps knocked and begged permission to stand at a window or in the hall until the rioters had passed but nobody interfered with them and when they had gone by everything went on as usual There still remained the fourth body and for that the secretary looked with a most intense eagerness At last it came up It was numerous and composed of picked men for as he gazed down among them he recognised many upturned faces which he knew well those of Simon Tappertit Hugh and Dennis in the front of course They halted and cheered as the others had done but when they moved again they did not like them proclaim what design they had Hugh merely raised his hat upon the bludgeon he carried and glancing at a spectator on the opposite side of the way was gone Gashford followed the direction of his glance instinctively and saw standing on the pavement and wearing the blue cockade Sir John Chester He held his hat an inch or two above his head to propitiate the mob and resting gracefully on his cane smiling pleasantly and displaying his dress and person to the very best advantage looked on in the most tranquil state imaginable For all that and quick and dexterous as he was Gashford had seen him recognise Hugh with the air of a patron He had no longer any eyes for the crowd but fixed his keen regards upon Sir John He stood in the same place and posture until the last man in the concourse had turned the corner of the street then very deliberately took the blue cockade out of his hat put it carefully in his pocket ready for the next emergency refreshed himself with a pinch of snuff put up his box and was walking slowly off when a passing carriage stopped and a lady s hand let down the glass Sir John s hat was off again immediately After a minute s conversation at the carriage window in which it was apparent that he was vastly entertaining on the subject of the mob he stepped lightly in and was driven away The secretary smiled but he had other thoughts to dwell upon and soon dismissed the topic Dinner was brought him but he sent it down untasted and in restless pacings up and down the room and constant glances at the clock and many futile efforts to sit down and read or go to sleep or look out of the window consumed four weary hours When the dial told him thus much time had crept away he stole upstairs to the top of the house and coming out upon the roof sat down with his face towards the east Heedless of the fresh air that blew upon his heated brow of the pleasant meadows from which he turned of the piles of roofs and chimneys upon which he looked of the smoke and rising mist he vainly sought to pierce of the shrill cries of children at their evening sports the distant hum and turmoil of the town the cheerful country breath that rustled past to meet it and to droop and die he watched and watched till it was dark save for the specks of light that twinkled in the streets below and far away and as the darkness deepened strained his gaze and grew more eager yet Nothing but gloom in that direction still he muttered restlessly Dog where is the redness in the sky you promised me Chapter 54 Rumours of the prevailing disturbances had by this time begun to be pretty generally circulated through the towns and villages round London and the tidings were everywhere received with that appetite for the marvellous and love of the terrible which have probably been among the natural characteristics of mankind since the creation of the world These accounts however appeared to many persons at that day as they would to us at the present but that we know them to be matter of history so monstrous and improbable that a great number of those who were resident at a distance and who were credulous enough on other points were really unable to bring their minds to believe that such things could be and rejected the intelligence they received on all hands as wholly fabulous and absurd Mr Willet not so much perhaps on account of his having argued and settled the matter with himself as by reason of his constitutional obstinacy was one of those who positively refused to entertain the current topic for a moment On this very evening and perhaps at the very time when Gashford kept his solitary watch old John was so red in the face with perpetually shaking his head in contradiction of his three ancient cronies and pot companions that he was quite a phenomenon to behold and lighted up the Maypole Porch wherein they sat together like a monstrous carbuncle in a fairy tale Do you think sir said Mr Willet looking hard at Solomon Daisy for it was his custom in cases of personal altercation to fasten upon the smallest man in the party do you think sir that I m a born fool No no Johnny returned Solomon looking round upon the little circle of which he formed a part We all know better than that You re no fool Johnny No no Mr Cobb and Mr Parkes shook their heads in unison muttering No no Johnny not you But as such compliments had usually the effect of making Mr Willet rather more dogged than before he surveyed them with a look of deep disdain and returned for answer Then what do you mean by coming here and telling me that this evening you re a going to walk up to London together you three you and have the evidence of your own senses An t said Mr Willet putting his pipe in his mouth with an air of solemn disgust an t the evidence of MY senses enough for you But we haven t got it Johnny pleaded Parkes humbly You haven t got it sir repeated Mr Willet eyeing him from top to toe You haven t got it sir You HAVE got it sir Don t I tell you that His blessed Majesty King George the Third would no more stand a rioting and rollicking in his streets than he d stand being crowed over by his own Parliament Yes Johnny but that s your sense not your senses said the adventurous Mr Parkes How do you know retorted John with great dignity You re a contradicting pretty free you are sir How do YOU know which it is I m not aware I ever told you sir Mr Parkes finding himself in the position of having got into metaphysics without exactly seeing his way out of them stammered forth an apology and retreated from the argument There then ensued a silence of some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at the expiration of which period Mr Willet was observed to rumble and shake with laughter and presently remarked in reference to his late adversary that he hoped he had tackled him enough Thereupon Messrs Cobb and Daisy laughed and nodded and Parkes was looked upon as thoroughly and effectually put down Do you suppose if all this was true that Mr Haredale would be constantly away from home as he is said John after another silence Do you think he wouldn t be afraid to leave his house with them two young women in it and only a couple of men or so Ay but then you know returned Solomon Daisy his house is a goodish way out of London and they do say that the rioters won t go more than two miles or three at the farthest off the stones Besides you know some of the Catholic gentlefolks have actually sent trinkets and suchlike down here for safety at least so the story goes The story goes said Mr Willet testily Yes sir The story goes that you saw a ghost last March But nobody believes it Well said Solomon rising to divert the attention of his two friends who tittered at this retort believed or disbelieved it s true and true or not if we mean to go to London we must be going at once So shake hands Johnny and good night I shall shake hands returned the landlord putting his into his pockets with no man as goes to London on such nonsensical errands The three cronies were therefore reduced to the necessity of shaking his elbows having performed that ceremony and brought from the house their hats and sticks and greatcoats they bade him good night and departed promising to bring him on the morrow full and true accounts of the real state of the city and if it were quiet to give him the full merit of his victory John Willet looked after them as they plodded along the road in the rich glow of a summer evening and knocking the ashes out of his pipe laughed inwardly at their folly until his sides were sore When he had quite exhausted himself which took some time for he laughed as slowly as he thought and spoke he sat himself comfortably with his back to the house put his legs upon the bench then his apron over his face and fell sound asleep How long he slept matters not but it was for no brief space for when he awoke the rich light had faded the sombre hues of night were falling fast upon the landscape and a few bright stars were already twinkling overhead The birds were all at roost the daisies on the green had closed their fairy hoods the honeysuckle twining round the porch exhaled its perfume in a twofold degree as though it lost its coyness at that silent time and loved to shed its fragrance on the night the ivy scarcely stirred its deep green leaves How tranquil and how beautiful it was Was there no sound in the air besides the gentle rustling of the trees and the grasshopper s merry chirp Hark Something very faint and distant not unlike the murmuring in a sea shell Now it grew louder fainter now and now it altogether died away Presently it came again subsided came once more grew louder fainter swelled into a roar It was on the road and varied with its windings All at once it burst into a distinct sound the voices and the tramping feet of many men It is questionable whether old John Willet even then would have thought of the rioters but for the cries of his cook and housemaid who ran screaming upstairs and locked themselves into one of the old garrets shrieking dismally when they had done so by way of rendering their place of refuge perfectly secret and secure These two females did afterwards depone that Mr Willet in his consternation uttered but one word and called that up the stairs in a stentorian voice six distinct times But as this word was a monosyllable which however inoffensive when applied to the quadruped it denotes is highly reprehensible when used in connection with females of unimpeachable character many persons were inclined to believe that the young women laboured under some hallucination caused by excessive fear and that their ears deceived them Be this as it may John Willet in whom the very uttermost extent of dull headed perplexity supplied the place of courage stationed himself in the porch and waited for their coming up Once it dimly occurred to him that there was a kind of door to the house which had a lock and bolts and at the same time some shadowy ideas of shutters to the lower windows flitted through his brain But he stood stock still looking down the road in the direction in which the noise was rapidly advancing and did not so much as take his hands out of his pockets He had not to wait long A dark mass looming through a cloud of dust soon became visible the mob quickened their pace shouting and whooping like savages they came rushing on pell mell and in a few seconds he was bandied from hand to hand in the heart of a crowd of men Halloa cried a voice he knew as the man who spoke came cleaving through the throng Where is he Give him to me Don t hurt him How now old Jack Ha ha ha Mr Willet looked at him and saw it was Hugh but he said nothing and thought nothing These lads are thirsty and must drink cried Hugh thrusting him back towards the house Bustle Jack bustle Show us the best the very best the over proof that you keep for your own drinking Jack John faintly articulated the words Who s to pay He says Who s to pay cried Hugh with a roar of laughter which was loudly echoed by the crowd Then turning to John he added Pay Why nobody John stared round at the mass of faces some grinning some fierce some lighted up by torches some indistinct some dusky and shadowy some looking at him some at his house some at each other and while he was as he thought in the very act of doing so found himself without any consciousness of having moved in the bar sitting down in an arm chair and watching the destruction of his property as if it were some queer play or entertainment of an astonishing and stupefying nature but having no reference to himself that he could make out at all Yes Here was the bar the bar that the boldest never entered without special invitation the sanctuary the mystery the hallowed ground here it was crammed with men clubs sticks torches pistols filled with a deafening noise oaths shouts screams hootings changed all at once into a bear garden a madhouse an infernal temple men darting in and out by door and window smashing the glass turning the taps drinking liquor out of China punchbowls sitting astride of casks smoking private and personal pipes cutting down the sacred grove of lemons hacking and hewing at the celebrated cheese breaking open inviolable drawers putting things in their pockets which didn t belong to them dividing his own money before his own eyes wantonly wasting breaking pulling down and tearing up nothing quiet nothing private men everywhere above below overhead in the bedrooms in the kitchen in the yard in the stables clambering in at windows when there were doors wide open dropping out of windows when the stairs were handy leaping over the bannisters into chasms of passages new faces and figures presenting themselves every instant some yelling some singing some fighting some breaking glass and crockery some laying the dust with the liquor they couldn t drink some ringing the bells till they pulled them down others beating them with pokers till they beat them into fragments more men still more more more swarming on like insects noise smoke light darkness frolic anger laughter groans plunder fear and ruin Nearly all the time while John looked on at this bewildering scene Hugh kept near him and though he was the loudest wildest most destructive villain there he saved his old master s bones a score of times Nay even when Mr Tappertit excited by liquor came up and in assertion of his prerogative politely kicked John Willet on the shins Hugh bade him return the compliment and if old John had had sufficient presence of mind to understand this whispered direction and to profit by it he might no doubt under Hugh s protection have done so with impunity At length the band began to reassemble outside the house and to call to those within to join them for they were losing time These murmurs increasing and attaining a high pitch Hugh and some of those who yet lingered in the bar and who plainly were the leaders of the troop took counsel together apart as to what was to be done with John to keep him quiet until their Chigwell work was over Some proposed to set the house on fire and leave him in it others that he should be reduced to a state of temporary insensibility by knocking on the head others that he should be sworn to sit where he was until to morrow at the same hour others again that he should be gagged and taken off with them under a sufficient guard All these propositions being overruled it was concluded at last to bind him in his chair and the word was passed for Dennis Look ee here Jack said Hugh striding up to him We are going to tie you hand and foot but otherwise you won t be hurt D ye hear John Willet looked at another man as if he didn t know which was the speaker and muttered something about an ordinary every Sunday at two o clock You won t be hurt I tell you Jack do you hear me roared Hugh impressing the assurance upon him by means of a heavy blow on the back He s so dead scared he s woolgathering I think Give him a drop of something to drink here Hand over one of you A glass of liquor being passed forward Hugh poured the contents down old John s throat Mr Willet feebly smacked his lips thrust his hand into his pocket and inquired what was to pay adding as he looked vacantly round that he believed there was a trifle of broken glass He s out of his senses for the time it s my belief said Hugh after shaking him without any visible effect upon his system until his keys rattled in his pocket Where s that Dennis The word was again passed and presently Mr Dennis with a long cord bound about his middle something after the manner of a friar came hurrying in attended by a body guard of half a dozen of his men Come Be alive here cried Hugh stamping his foot upon the ground Make haste Dennis with a wink and a nod unwound the cord from about his person and raising his eyes to the ceiling looked all over it and round the walls and cornice with a curious eye then shook his head Move man can t you cried Hugh with another impatient stamp of his foot Are we to wait here till the cry has gone for ten miles round and our work s interrupted It s all very fine talking brother answered Dennis stepping towards him but unless and here he whispered in his ear unless we do it over the door it can t be done at all in this here room What can t Hugh demanded What can t retorted Dennis Why the old man can t Why you weren t going to hang him cried Hugh No brother returned the hangman with a stare What else Hugh made no answer but snatching the rope from his companion s hand proceeded to bind old John himself but his very first move was so bungling and unskilful that Mr Dennis entreated almost with tears in his eyes that he might be permitted to perform the duty Hugh consenting be achieved it in a twinkling There he said looking mournfully at John Willet who displayed no more emotion in his bonds than he had shown out of them That s what I call pretty and workmanlike He s quite a picter now But brother just a word with you now that he s ready trussed as one may say wouldn t it be better for all parties if we was to work him off It would read uncommon well in the newspapers it would indeed The public would think a great deal more on us Hugh inferring what his companion meant rather from his gestures than his technical mode of expressing himself to which as he was ignorant of his calling he wanted the clue rejected this proposition for the second time and gave the word Forward which was echoed by a hundred voices from without To the Warren shouted Dennis as he ran out followed by the rest A witness s house my lads A loud yell followed and the whole throng hurried off mad for pillage and destruction Hugh lingered behind for a few moments to stimulate himself with more drink and to set all the taps running a few of which had accidentally been spared then glancing round the despoiled and plundered room through whose shattered window the rioters had thrust the Maypole itself for even that had been sawn down lighted a torch clapped the mute and motionless John Willet on the back and waving his light above his head and uttering a fierce shout hastened after his companions Chapter 55 John Willet left alone in his dismantled bar continued to sit staring about him awake as to his eyes certainly but with all his powers of reason and reflection in a sound and dreamless sleep He looked round upon the room which had been for years and was within an hour ago the pride of his heart and not a muscle of his face was moved The night without looked black and cold through the dreary gaps in the casement the precious liquids now nearly leaked away dripped with a hollow sound upon the floor the Maypole peered ruefully in through the broken window like the bowsprit of a wrecked ship the ground might have been the bottom of the sea it was so strewn with precious fragments Currents of air rushed in as the old doors jarred and creaked upon their hinges the candles flickered and guttered down and made long winding sheets the cheery deep red curtains flapped and fluttered idly in the wind even the stout Dutch kegs overthrown and lying empty in dark corners seemed the mere husks of good fellows whose jollity had departed and who could kindle with a friendly glow no more John saw this desolation and yet saw it not He was perfectly contented to sit there staring at it and felt no more indignation or discomfort in his bonds than if they had been robes of honour So far as he was personally concerned old Time lay snoring and the world stood still Save for the dripping from the barrels the rustling of such light fragments of destruction as the wind affected and the dull creaking of the open doors all was profoundly quiet indeed these sounds like the ticking of the death watch in the night only made the silence they invaded deeper and more apparent But quiet or noisy it was all one to John If a train of heavy artillery could have come up and commenced ball practice outside the window it would have been all the same to him He was a long way beyond surprise A ghost couldn t have overtaken him By and by he heard a footstep a hurried and yet cautious footstep coming on towards the house It stopped advanced again then seemed to go quite round it Having done that it came beneath the window and a head looked in It was strongly relieved against the darkness outside by the glare of the guttering candles A pale worn withered face the eyes but that was owing to its gaunt condition unnaturally large and bright the hair a grizzled black It gave a searching glance all round the room and a deep voice said Are you alone in this house John made no sign though the question was repeated twice and he heard it distinctly After a moment s pause the man got in at the window John was not at all surprised at this either There had been so much getting in and out of window in the course of the last hour or so that he had quite forgotten the door and seemed to have lived among such exercises from infancy The man wore a large dark faded cloak and a slouched hat he walked up close to John and looked at him John returned the compliment with interest How long have you been sitting thus said the man John considered but nothing came of it Which way have the party gone Some wandering speculations relative to the fashion of the stranger s boots got into Mr Willet s mind by some accident or other but they got out again in a hurry and left him in his former state You would do well to speak said the man you may keep a whole skin though you have nothing else left that can be hurt Which way have the party gone That said John finding his voice all at once and nodding with perfect good faith he couldn t point he was so tightly bound in exactly the opposite direction to the right one You lie said the man angrily and with a threatening gesture I came that way You would betray me It was so evident that John s imperturbability was not assumed but was the result of the late proceedings under his roof that the man stayed his hand in the very act of striking him and turned away John looked after him without so much as a twitch in a single nerve of his face He seized a glass and holding it under one of the little casks until a few drops were collected drank them greedily off then throwing it down upon the floor impatiently he took the vessel in his hands and drained it into his throat Some scraps of bread and meat were scattered about and on these he fell next eating them with voracity and pausing every now and then to listen for some fancied noise outside When he had refreshed himself in this manner with violent haste and raised another barrel to his lips he pulled his hat upon his brow as though he were about to leave the house and turned to John Where are your servants Mr Willet indistinctly remembered to have heard the rioters calling to them to throw the key of the room in which they were out of window for their keeping He therefore replied Locked up Well for them if they remain quiet and well for you if you do the like said the man Now show me the way the party went This time Mr Willet indicated it correctly The man was hurrying to the door when suddenly there came towards them on the wind the loud and rapid tolling of an alarm bell and then a bright and vivid glare streamed up which illumined not only the whole chamber but all the country It was not the sudden change from darkness to this dreadful light it was not the sound of distant shrieks and shouts of triumph it was not this dread invasion of the serenity and peace of night that drove the man back as though a thunderbolt had struck him It was the Bell If the ghastliest shape the human mind has ever pictured in its wildest dreams had risen up before him he could not have staggered backward from its touch as he did from the first sound of that loud iron voice With eyes that started from his head his limbs convulsed his face most horrible to see he raised one arm high up into the air and holding something visionary back and down with his other hand drove at it as though he held a knife and stabbed it to the heart He clutched his hair and stopped his ears and travelled madly round and round then gave a frightful cry and with it rushed away still still the Bell tolled on and seemed to follow him louder and louder hotter and hotter yet The glare grew brighter the roar of voices deeper the crash of heavy bodies falling shook the air bright streams of sparks rose up into the sky but louder than them all rising faster far to Heaven a million times more fierce and furious pouring forth dreadful secrets after its long silence speaking the language of the dead the Bell the Bell What hunt of spectres could surpass that dread pursuit and flight Had there been a legion of them on his track he could have better borne it They would have had a beginning and an end but here all space was full The one pursuing voice was everywhere it sounded in the earth the air shook the long grass and howled among the trembling trees The echoes caught it up the owls hooted as it flew upon the breeze the nightingale was silent and hid herself among the thickest boughs it seemed to goad and urge the angry fire and lash it into madness everything was steeped in one prevailing red the glow was everywhere nature was drenched in blood still the remorseless crying of that awful voice the Bell the Bell It ceased but not in his ears The knell was at his heart No work of man had ever voice like that which sounded there and warned him that it cried unceasingly to Heaven Who could hear that hell and not know what it said There was murder in its every note cruel relentless savage murder the murder of a confiding man by one who held his every trust Its ringing summoned phantoms from their graves What face was that in which a friendly smile changed to a look of half incredulous horror which stiffened for a moment into one of pain then changed again into an imploring glance at Heaven and so fell idly down with upturned eyes like the dead stags he had often peeped at when a little child shrinking and shuddering there was a dreadful thing to think of now and clinging to an apron as he looked He sank upon the ground and grovelling down as if he would dig himself a place to hide in covered his face and ears but no no no a hundred walls and roofs of brass would not shut out that bell for in it spoke the wrathful voice of God and from that voice the whole wide universe could not afford a refuge While he rushed up and down not knowing where to turn and while he lay crouching there the work went briskly on indeed When they left the Maypole the rioters formed into a solid body and advanced at a quick pace towards the Warren Rumour of their approach having gone before they found the garden doors fast closed the windows made secure and the house profoundly dark not a light being visible in any portion of the building After some fruitless ringing at the bells and beating at the iron gates they drew off a few paces to reconnoitre and confer upon the course it would be best to take Very little conference was needed when all were bent upon one desperate purpose infuriated with liquor and flushed with successful riot The word being given to surround the house some climbed the gates or dropped into the shallow trench and scaled the garden wall while others pulled down the solid iron fence and while they made a breach to enter by made deadly weapons of the bars The house being completely encircled a small number of men were despatched to break open a tool shed in the garden and during their absence on this errand the remainder contented themselves with knocking violently at the doors and calling to those within to come down and open them on peril of their lives No answer being returned to this repeated summons and the detachment who had been sent away coming back with an accession of pickaxes spades and hoes they together with those who had such arms already or carried as many did axes poles and crowbars struggled into the foremost rank ready to beset the doors and windows They had not at this time more than a dozen lighted torches among them but when these preparations were completed flaming links were distributed and passed from hand to hand with such rapidity that in a minute s time at least two thirds of the whole roaring mass bore each man in his hand a blazing brand Whirling these about their heads they raised a loud shout and fell to work upon the doors and windows Amidst the clattering of heavy blows the rattling of broken glass the cries and execrations of the mob and all the din and turmoil of the scene Hugh and his friends kept together at the turret door where Mr Haredale had last admitted him and old John Willet and spent their united force on that It was a strong old oaken door guarded by good bolts and a heavy bar but it soon went crashing in upon the narrow stairs behind and made as it were a platform to facilitate their tearing up into the rooms above Almost at the same moment a dozen other points were forced and at every one the crowd poured in like water A few armed servant men were posted in the hall and when the rioters forced an entrance there they fired some half a dozen shots But these taking no effect and the concourse coming on like an army of devils they only thought of consulting their own safety and retreated echoing their assailants cries and hoping in the confusion to be taken for rioters themselves in which stratagem they succeeded with the exception of one old man who was never heard of again and was said to have had his brains beaten out with an iron bar one of his fellows reported that he had seen the old man fall and to have been afterwards burnt in the flames The besiegers being now in complete possession of the house spread themselves over it from garret to cellar and plied their demon labours fiercely While some small parties kindled bonfires underneath the windows others broke up the furniture and cast the fragments down to feed the flames below where the apertures in the wall windows no longer were large enough they threw out tables chests of drawers beds mirrors pictures and flung them whole into the fire while every fresh addition to the blazing masses was received with shouts and howls and yells which added new and dismal terrors to the conflagration Those who had axes and had spent their fury on the movables chopped and tore down the doors and window frames broke up the flooring hewed away the rafters and buried men who lingered in the upper rooms in heaps of ruins Some searched the drawers the chests the boxes writing desks and closets for jewels plate and money while others less mindful of gain and more mad for destruction cast their whole contents into the courtyard without examination and called to those below to heap them on the blaze Men who had been into the cellars and had staved the casks rushed to and fro stark mad setting fire to all they saw often to the dresses of their own friends and kindling the building in so many parts that some had no time for escape and were seen with drooping hands and blackened faces hanging senseless on the window sills to which they had crawled until they were sucked and drawn into the burning gulf The more the fire crackled and raged the wilder and more cruel the men grew as though moving in that element they became fiends and changed their earthly nature for the qualities that give delight in hell The burning pile revealing rooms and passages red hot through gaps made in the crumbling walls the tributary fires that licked the outer bricks and stones with their long forked tongues and ran up to meet the glowing mass within the shining of the flames upon the villains who looked on and fed them the roaring of the angry blaze so bright and high that it seemed in its rapacity to have swallowed up the very smoke the living flakes the wind bore rapidly away and hurried on with like a storm of fiery snow the noiseless breaking of great beams of wood which fell like feathers on the heap of ashes and crumbled in the very act to sparks and powder the lurid tinge that overspread the sky and the darkness very deep by contrast which prevailed around the exposure to the coarse common gaze of every little nook which usages of home had made a sacred place and the destruction by rude hands of every little household favourite which old associations made a dear and precious thing all this taking place not among pitying looks and friendly murmurs of compassion but brutal shouts and exultations which seemed to make the very rats who stood by the old house too long creatures with some claim upon the pity and regard of those its roof had sheltered combined to form a scene never to be forgotten by those who saw it and were not actors in the work so long as life endured And who were they The alarm bell rang and it was pulled by no faint or hesitating hands for a long time but not a soul was seen Some of the insurgents said that when it ceased they heard the shrieks of women and saw some garments fluttering in the air as a party of men bore away no unresisting burdens No one could say that this was true or false in such an uproar but where was Hugh Who among them had seen him since the forcing of the doors The cry spread through the body Where was Hugh Here he hoarsely cried appearing from the darkness out of breath and blackened with the smoke We have done all we can the fire is burning itself out and even the corners where it hasn t spread are nothing but heaps of ruins Disperse my lads while the coast s clear get back by different ways and meet as usual With that he disappeared again contrary to his wont for he was always first to advance and last to go away leaving them to follow homewards as they would It was not an easy task to draw off such a throng If Bedlam gates had been flung wide open there would not have issued forth such maniacs as the frenzy of that night had made There were men there who danced and trampled on the beds of flowers as though they trod down human enemies and wrenched them from the stalks like savages who twisted human necks There were men who cast their lighted torches in the air and suffered them to fall upon their heads and faces blistering the skin with deep unseemly burns There were men who rushed up to the fire and paddled in it with their hands as if in water and others who were restrained by force from plunging in to gratify their deadly longing On the skull of one drunken lad not twenty by his looks who lay upon the ground with a bottle to his mouth the lead from the roof came streaming down in a shower of liquid fire white hot melting his head like wax When the scattered parties were collected men living yet but singed as with hot irons were plucked out of the cellars and carried off upon the shoulders of others who strove to wake them as they went along with ribald jokes and left them dead in the passages of hospitals But of all the howling throng not one learnt mercy from or sickened at these sights nor was the fierce besotted senseless rage of one man glutted Slowly and in small clusters with hoarse hurrahs and repetitions of their usual cry the assembly dropped away The last few red eyed stragglers reeled after those who had gone before the distant noise of men calling to each other and whistling for others whom they missed grew fainter and fainter at length even these sounds died away and silence reigned alone Silence indeed The glare of the flames had sunk into a fitful flashing light and the gentle stars invisible till now looked down upon the blackening heap A dull smoke hung upon the ruin as though to hide it from those eyes of Heaven and the wind forbore to move it Bare walls roof open to the sky chambers where the beloved dead had many and many a fair day risen to new life and energy where so many dear ones had been sad and merry which were connected with so many thoughts and hopes regrets and changes all gone Nothing left but a dull and dreary blank a smouldering heap of dust and ashes the silence and solitude of utter desolation Chapter 56 The Maypole cronies little drearning of the change so soon to come upon their favourite haunt struck through the Forest path upon their way to London and avoiding the main road which was hot and dusty kept to the by paths and the fields As they drew nearer to their destination they began to make inquiries of the people whom they passed concerning the riots and the truth or falsehood of the stories they had heard The answers went far beyond any intelligence that had spread to quiet Chigwell One man told them that that afternoon the Guards conveying to Newgate some rioters who had been re examined had been set upon by the mob and compelled to retreat another that the houses of two witnesses near Clare Market were about to be pulled down when he came away another that Sir George Saville s house in Leicester Fields was to be burned that night and that it would go hard with Sir George if he fell into the people s hands as it was he who had brought in the Catholic bill All accounts agreed that the mob were out in stronger numbers and more numerous parties than had yet appeared that the streets were unsafe that no man s house or life was worth an hour s purchase that the public consternation was increasing every moment and that many families had already fled the city One fellow who wore the popular colour damned them for not having cockades in their hats and bade them set a good watch to morrow night upon their prison doors for the locks would have a straining another asked if they were fire proof that they walked abroad without the distinguishing mark of all good and true men and a third who rode on horseback and was quite alone ordered them to throw each man a shilling in his hat towards the support of the rioters Although they were afraid to refuse compliance with this demand and were much alarmed by these reports they agreed having come so far to go forward and see the real state of things with their own eyes So they pushed on quicker as men do who are excited by portentous news and ruminating on what they had heard spoke little to each other It was now night and as they came nearer to the city they had dismal confirmation of this intelligence in three great fires all close together which burnt fiercely and were gloomily reflected in the sky Arriving in the immediate suburbs they found that almost every house had chalked upon its door in large characters No Popery that the shops were shut and that alarm and anxiety were depicted in every face they passed Noting these things with a degree of apprehension which neither of the three cared to impart in its full extent to his companions they came to a turnpike gate which was shut They were passing through the turnstile on the path when a horseman rode up from London at a hard gallop and called to the toll keeper in a voice of great agitation to open quickly in the name of God The adjuration was so earnest and vehement that the man with a lantern in his hand came running out toll keeper though he was and was about to throw the gate open when happening to look behind him he exclaimed Good Heaven what s that Another fire At this the three turned their heads and saw in the distance straight in the direction whence they had come a broad sheet of flame casting a threatening light upon the clouds which glimmered as though the conflagration were behind them and showed like a wrathful sunset My mind misgives me said the horseman or I know from what far building those flames come Don t stand aghast my good fellow Open the gate Sir cried the man laying his hand upon his horse s bridle as he let him through I know you now sir be advised by me do not go on I saw them pass and know what kind of men they are You will be murdered So be it said the horseman looking intently towards the fire and not at him who spoke But sir sir cried the man grasping at his rein more tightly yet if you do go on wear the blue riband Here sir he added taking one from his own hat it s necessity not choice that makes me wear it it s love of life and home sir Wear it for this one night sir only for this one night Do cried the three friends pressing round his horse Mr Haredale worthy sir good gentleman pray be persuaded Who s that cried Mr Haredale stooping down to look Did I hear Daisy s voice You did sir cried the little man Do be persuaded sir This gentleman says very true Your life may hang upon it Are you said Mr Haredale abruptly afraid to come with me I sir N n no Put that riband in your hat If we meet the rioters swear that I took you prisoner for wearing it I will tell them so with my own lips for as I hope for mercy when I die I will take no quarter from them nor shall they have quarter from me if we come hand to hand to night Up here behind me quick Clasp me tight round the body and fear nothing In an instant they were riding away at full gallop in a dense cloud of dust and speeding on like hunters in a dream It was well the good horse knew the road he traversed for never once no never once in all the journey did Mr Haredale cast his eyes upon the ground or turn them for an instant from the light towards which they sped so madly Once he said in a low voice It is my house but that was the only time he spoke When they came to dark and doubtful places he never forgot to put his hand upon the little man to hold him more securely in his seat but he kept his head erect and his eyes fixed on the fire then and always The road was dangerous enough for they went the nearest way headlong far from the highway by lonely lanes and paths where waggon wheels had worn deep ruts where hedge and ditch hemmed in the narrow strip of ground and tall trees arching overhead made it profoundly dark But on on on with neither stop nor stumble till they reached the Maypole door and could plainly see that the fire began to fade as if for want of fuel Down for one moment for but one moment said Mr Haredale helping Daisy to the ground and following himself Willet Willet where are my niece and servants Willet Crying to him distractedly he rushed into the bar The landlord bound and fastened to his chair the place dismantled stripped and pulled about his ears nobody could have taken shelter here He was a strong man accustomed to restrain himself and suppress his strong emotions but this preparation for what was to follow though he had seen that fire burning and knew that his house must be razed to the ground was more than he could bear He covered his face with his hands for a moment and turned away his head Johnny Johnny said Solomon and the simple hearted fellow cried outright and wrung his hands Oh dear old Johnny here s a change That the Maypole bar should come to this and we should live to see it The old Warren too Johnny Mr Haredale oh Johnny what a piteous sight this is Pointing to Mr Haredale as he said these words little Solomon Daisy put his elbows on the back of Mr Willet s chair and fairly blubbered on his shoulder While Solomon was speaking old John sat mute as a stock fish staring at him with an unearthly glare and displaying by every possible symptom entire and complete unconsciousness But when Solomon was silent again John followed with his great round eyes the direction of his looks and did appear to have some dawning distant notion that somebody had come to see him You know us don t you Johnny said the little clerk rapping himself on the breast Daisy you know Chigwell Church bell ringer little desk on Sundays eh Johnny Mr Willet reflected for a few moments and then muttered as it were mechanically Let us sing to the praise and glory of Yes to be sure cried the little man hastily that s it that s me Johnny You re all right now an t you Say you re all right Johnny All right pondered Mr Willet as if that were a matter entirely between himself and his conscience All right Ah They haven t been misusing you with sticks or pokers or any other blunt instruments have they Johnny asked Solomon with a very anxious glance at Mr Willet s head They didn t beat you did they John knitted his brow looked downwards as if he were mentally engaged in some arithmetical calculation then upwards as if the total would not come at his call then at Solomon Daisy from his eyebrow to his shoe buckle then very slowly round the bar And then a great round leaden looking and not at all transparent tear came rolling out of each eye and he said as he shook his head If they d only had the goodness to murder me I d have thanked em kindly No no no don t say that Johnny whimpered his little friend It s very very bad but not quite so bad as that No no Look ee here sir cried John turning his rueful eyes on Mr Haredale who had dropped on one knee and was hastily beginning to untie his bonds Look ee here sir The very Maypole the old dumb Maypole stares in at the winder as if it said John Willet John Willet let s go and pitch ourselves in the nighest pool of water as is deep enough to hold us for our day is over Don t Johnny don t cried his friend no less affected with this mournful effort of Mr Willet s imagination than by the sepulchral tone in which he had spoken of the Maypole Please don t Johnny Your loss is great and your misfortune a heavy one said Mr Haredale looking restlessly towards the door and this is not a time to comfort you If it were I am in no condition to do so Before I leave you tell me one thing and try to tell me plainly I implore you Have you seen or heard of Emma No said Mr Willet Nor any one but these bloodhounds No They rode away I trust in Heaven before these dreadful scenes began said Mr Haredale who between his agitation his eagerness to mount his horse again and the dexterity with which the cords were tied had scarcely yet undone one knot A knife Daisy You didn t said John looking about as though he had lost his pocket handkerchief or some such slight article either of you gentlemen see a a coffin anywheres did you Willet cried Mr Haredale Solomon dropped the knife and instantly becoming limp from head to foot exclaimed Good gracious Because said John not at all regarding them a dead man called a little time ago on his way yonder I could have told you what name was on the plate if he had brought his coffin with him and left it behind If he didn t it don t signify His landlord who had listened to these words with breathless attention started that moment to his feet and without a word drew Solomon Daisy to the door mounted his horse took him up behind again and flew rather than galloped towards the pile of ruins which that day s sun had shone upon a stately house Mr Willet stared after them listened looked down upon himself to make quite sure that he was still unbound and without any manifestation of impatience disappointment or surprise gently relapsed into the condition from which he had so imperfectly recovered Mr Haredale tied his horse to the trunk of a tree and grasping his companion s arm stole softly along the footpath and into what had been the garden of his house He stopped for an instant to look upon its smoking walls and at the stars that shone through roof and floor upon the heap of crumbling ashes Solomon glanced timidly in his face but his lips were tightly pressed together a resolute and stern expression sat upon his brow and not a tear a look or gesture indicating grief escaped him He drew his sword felt for a moment in his breast as though he carried other arms about him then grasping Solomon by the wrist again went with a cautious step all round the house He looked into every doorway and gap in the wall retraced his steps at every rustling of the air among the leaves and searched in every shadowed nook with outstretched hands Thus they made the circuit of the building but they returned to the spot from which they had set out without encountering any human being or finding the least trace of any concealed straggler After a short pause Mr Haredale shouted twice or thrice Then cried aloud Is there any one in hiding here who knows my voice There is nothing to fear now If any of my people are near I entreat them to answer He called them all by name his voice was echoed in many mournful tones then all was silent as before They were standing near the foot of the turret where the alarm bell hung The fire had raged there and the floors had been sawn and hewn and beaten down besides It was open to the night but a part of the staircase still remained winding upward from a great mound of dust and cinders Fragments of the jagged and broken steps offered an insecure and giddy footing here and there and then were lost again behind protruding angles of the wall or in the deep shadows cast upon it by other portions of the ruin for by this time the moon had risen and shone brightly As they stood here listening to the echoes as they died away and hoping in vain to hear a voice they knew some of the ashes in this turret slipped and rolled down Startled by the least noise in that melancholy place Solomon looked up in his companion s face and saw that he had turned towards the spot and that he watched and listened keenly He covered the little man s mouth with his hand and looked again Instantly with kindling eyes he bade him on his life keep still and neither speak nor move Then holding his breath and stooping down he stole into the turret with his drawn sword in his hand and disappeared Terrified to be left there by himself under such desolate circumstances and after all he had seen and heard that night Solomon would have followed but there had been something in Mr Haredale s manner and his look the recollection of which held him spellbound He stood rooted to the spot and scarcely venturing to breathe looked up with mingled fear and wonder Again the ashes slipped and rolled very very softly again and then again as though they crumbled underneath the tread of a stealthy foot And now a figure was dimly visible climbing very softly and often stopping to look down now it pursued its difficult way and now it was hidden from the view again It emerged once more into the shadowy and uncertain light higher now but not much for the way was steep and toilsome and its progress very slow What phantom of the brain did he pursue and why did he look down so constantly He knew he was alone Surely his mind was not affected by that night s loss and agony He was not about to throw himself headlong from the summit of the tottering wall Solomon turned sick and clasped his hands His limbs trembled beneath him and a cold sweat broke out upon his pallid face If he complied with Mr Haredale s last injunction now it was because he had not the power to speak or move He strained his gaze and fixed it on a patch of moonlight into which if he continued to ascend he must soon emerge When he appeared there he would try to call to him Again the ashes slipped and crumbled some stones rolled down and fell with a dull heavy sound upon the ground below He kept his eyes upon the piece of moonlight The figure was coming on for its shadow was already thrown upon the wall Now it appeared and now looked round at him and now The horror stricken clerk uttered a scream that pierced the air and cried The ghost The ghost Long before the echo of his cry had died away another form rushed out into the light flung itself upon the foremost one knelt down upon its breast and clutched its throat with both hands Villain cried Mr Haredale in a terrible voice for it was he Dead and buried as all men supposed through your infernal arts but reserved by Heaven for this at last at last I have you You whose hands are red with my brother s blood and that of his faithful servant shed to conceal your own atrocious guilt You Rudge double murderer and monster I arrest you in the name of God who has delivered you into my hands No Though you had the strength of twenty men he added as the murderer writhed and struggled you could not escape me or loosen my grasp to night Chapter 57 Barnaby armed as we have seen continued to pace up and down before the stable door glad to be alone again and heartily rejoicing in the unaccustomed silence and tranquillity After the whirl of noise and riot in which the last two days had been passed the pleasures of solitude and peace were enhanced a thousandfold He felt quite happy and as he leaned upon his staff and mused a bright smile overspread his face and none but cheerful visions floated into his brain Had he no thoughts of her whose sole delight he was and whom he had unconsciously plunged in such bitter sorrow and such deep affliction Oh yes She was at the heart of all his cheerful hopes and proud reflections It was she whom all this honour and distinction were to gladden the joy and profit were for her What delight it gave her to hear of the bravery of her poor boy Ah He would have known that without Hugh s telling him And what a precious thing it was to know she lived so happily and heard with so much pride he pictured to himself her look when they told her that he was in such high esteem bold among the boldest and trusted before them all And when these frays were over and the good lord had conquered his enemies and they were all at peace again and he and she were rich what happiness they would have in talking of these troubled times when he was a great soldier and when they sat alone together in the tranquil twilight and she had no longer reason to be anxious for the morrow what pleasure would he have in the reflection that this was his doing his poor foolish Barnaby s and in patting her on the cheek and saying with a merry laugh Am I silly now mother am I silly now With a lighter heart and step and eyes the brighter for the happy tear that dimmed them for a moment Barnaby resumed his walk and singing gaily to himself kept guard upon his quiet post His comrade Grip the partner of his watch though fond of basking in the sunshine preferred to day to walk about the stable having a great deal to do in the way of scattering the straw hiding under it such small articles as had been casually left about and haunting Hugh s bed to which he seemed to have taken a particular attachment Sometimes Barnaby looked in and called him and then he came hopping out but he merely did this as a concession to his master s weakness and soon returned again to his own grave pursuits peering into the straw with his bill and rapidly covering up the place as if Midas like he were whispering secrets to the earth and burying them constantly busying himself upon the sly and affecting whenever Barnaby came past to look up in the clouds and have nothing whatever on his mind in short conducting himself in many respects in a more than usually thoughtful deep and mysterious manner As the day crept on Barnaby who had no directions forbidding him to eat and drink upon his post but had been on the contrary supplied with a bottle of beer and a basket of provisions determined to break his fast which he had not done since morning To this end he sat down on the ground before the door and putting his staff across his knees in case of alarm or surprise summoned Grip to dinner This call the bird obeyed with great alacrity crying as he sidled up to his master I m a devil I m a Polly I m a kettle I m a Protestant No Popery Having learnt this latter sentiment from the gentry among whom he had lived of late he delivered it with uncommon emphasis Well said Grip cried his master as he fed him with the daintiest bits Well said old boy Never say die bow wow wow keep up your spirits Grip Grip Grip Holloa We ll all have tea I m a Protestant kettle No Popery cried the raven Gordon for ever Grip cried Barnaby The raven placing his head upon the ground looked at his master sideways as though he would have said Say that again Perfectly understanding his desire Barnaby repeated the phrase a great many times The bird listened with profound attention sometimes repeating the popular cry in a low voice as if to compare the two and try if it would at all help him to this new accomplishment sometimes flapping his wings or barking and sometimes in a kind of desperation drawing a multitude of corks with extraordinary viciousness Barnaby was so intent upon his favourite that he was not at first aware of the approach of two persons on horseback who were riding at a foot pace and coming straight towards his post When he perceived them however which he did when they were within some fifty yards of him he jumped hastily up and ordering Grip within doors stood with both hands on his staff waiting until he should know whether they were friends or foes He had hardly done so when he observed that those who advanced were a gentleman and his servant almost at the same moment he recognised Lord George Gordon before whom he stood uncovered with his eyes turned towards the ground Good day said Lord George not reining in his horse until he was close beside him Well All quiet sir all safe cried Barnaby The rest are away they went by that path that one A grand party Ay said Lord George looking thoughtfully at him And you Oh They left me here to watch to mount guard to keep everything secure till they come back I ll do it sir for your sake You re a good gentleman a kind gentleman ay you are There are many against you but we ll be a match for them never fear What s that said Lord George pointing to the raven who was peeping out of the stable door but still looking thoughtfully and in some perplexity it seemed at Barnaby Why don t you know retorted Barnaby with a wondering laugh Not know what HE is A bird to be sure My bird my friend Grip A devil a kettle a Grip a Polly a Protestant no Popery cried the raven Though indeed added Barnaby laying his hand upon the neck of Lord George s horse and speaking softly you had good reason to ask me what he is for sometimes it puzzles me and I am used to him to think he s only a bird He s my brother Grip is always with me always talking always merry eh Grip The raven answered by an affectionate croak and hopping on his master s arm which he held downward for that purpose submitted with an air of perfect indifference to be fondled and turned his restless curious eye now upon Lord George and now upon his man Lord George biting his nails in a discomfited manner regarded Barnaby for some time in silence then beckoning to his servant said Come hither John John Grueby touched his hat and came Have you ever seen this young man before his master asked in a low voice Twice my lord said John I saw him in the crowd last night and Saturday Did did it seem to you that his manner was at all wild or strange Lord George demanded faltering Mad said John with emphatic brevity And why do you think him mad sir said his master speaking in a peevish tone Don t use that word too freely Why do you think him mad My lord John Grueby answered look at his dress look at his eyes look at his restless way hear him cry No Popery Mad my lord So because one man dresses unlike another returned his angry master glancing at himself and happens to differ from other men in his carriage and manner and to advocate a great cause which the corrupt and irreligious desert he is to be accounted mad is he Stark staring raving roaring mad my lord returned the unmoved John Do you say this to my face cried his master turning sharply upon him To any man my lord who asks me answered John Mr Gashford I find was right said Lord George I thought him prejudiced though I ought to have known a man like him better than to have supposed it possible I shall never have Mr Gashford s good word my lord replied John touching his hat respectfully and I don t covet it You are an ill conditioned most ungrateful fellow said Lord George a spy for anything I know Mr Gashford is perfectly correct as I might have felt convinced he was I have done wrong to retain you in my service It is a tacit insult to him as my choice and confidential friend to do so remembering the cause you sided with on the day he was maligned at Westminster You will leave me to night nay as soon as we reach home The sooner the better If it comes to that I say so too my lord Let Mr Gashford have his will As to my being a spy my lord you know me better than to believe it I am sure I don t know much about causes My cause is the cause of one man against two hundred and I hope it always will be You have said quite enough returned Lord George motioning him to go back I desire to hear no more If you ll let me have another word my lord returned John Grueby I d give this silly fellow a caution not to stay here by himself The proclamation is in a good many hands already and it s well known that he was concerned in the business it relates to He had better get to a place of safety if he can poor creature You hear what this man says cried Lord George addressing Barnaby who had looked on and wondered while this dialogue passed He thinks you may be afraid to remain upon your post and are kept here perhaps against your will What do you say I think young man said John in explanation that the soldiers may turn out and take you and that if they do you will certainly be hung by the neck till you re dead dead dead And I think you had better go from here as fast as you can That s what I think He s a coward Grip a coward cried Barnaby putting the raven on the ground and shouldering his staff Let them come Gordon for ever Let them come Ay said Lord George let them Let us see who will venture to attack a power like ours the solemn league of a whole people THIS a madman You have said well very well I am proud to be the leader of such men as you Bamaby s heart swelled within his bosom as he heard these words He took Lord George s hand and carried it to his lips patted his horse s crest as if the affection and admiration he had conceived for the man extended to the animal he rode then unfurling his flag and proudly waving it resumed his pacing up and down Lord George with a kindling eye and glowing cheek took off his hat and flourishing it above his head bade him exultingly Farewell then cantered off at a brisk pace after glancing angrily round to see that his servant followed Honest John set spurs to his horse and rode after his master but not before he had again warned Barnaby to retreat with many significant gestures which indeed he continued to make and Barnaby to resist until the windings of the road concealed them from each other s view Left to himself again with a still higher sense of the importance of his post and stimulated to enthusiasm by the special notice and encouragement of his leader Barnaby walked to and fro in a delicious trance rather than as a waking man The sunshine which prevailed around was in his mind He had but one desire ungratified If she could only see him now The day wore on its heat was gently giving place to the cool of evening a light wind sprung up fanning his long hair and making the banner rustle pleasantly above his head There was a freedom and freshness in the sound and in the time which chimed exactly with his mood He was happier than ever He was leaning on his staff looking towards the declining sun and reflecting with a smile that he stood sentinel at that moment over buried gold when two or three figures appeared in the distance making towards the house at a rapid pace and motioning with their hands as though they urged its inmates to retreat from some approaching danger As they drew nearer they became more earnest in their gestures and they were no sooner within hearing than the foremost among them cried that the soldiers were coming up At these words Barnaby furled his flag and tied it round the pole His heart beat high while he did so but he had no more fear or thought of retreating than the pole itself The friendly stragglers hurried past him after giving him notice of his danger and quickly passed into the house where the utmost confusion immediately prevailed As those within hastily closed the windows and the doors they urged him by looks and signs to fly without loss of time and called to him many times to do so but he only shook his head indignantly in answer and stood the firmer on his post Finding that he was not to be persuaded they took care of themselves and leaving the place with only one old woman in it speedily withdrew As yet there had been no symptom of the news having any better foundation than in the fears of those who brought it but The Boot had not been deserted five minutes when there appeared coming across the fields a body of men who it was easy to see by the glitter of their arms and ornaments in the sun and by their orderly and regular mode of advancing for they came on as one man were soldiers In a very little time Barnaby knew that they were a strong detachment of the Foot Guards having along with them two gentlemen in private clothes and a small party of Horse the latter brought up the rear and were not in number more than six or eight They advanced steadily neither quickening their pace as they came nearer nor raising any cry nor showing the least emotion or anxiety Though this was a matter of course in the case of regular troops even to Barnaby there was something particularly impressive and disconcerting in it to one accustomed to the noise and tumult of an undisciplined mob For all that he stood his ground not a whit the less resolutely and looked on undismayed Presently they marched into the yard and halted The commanding officer despatched a messenger to the horsemen one of whom came riding back Some words passed between them and they glanced at Barnaby who well remembered the man he had unhorsed at Westminster and saw him now before his eyes The man being speedily dismissed saluted and rode back to his comrades who were drawn up apart at a short distance The officer then gave the word to prime and load The heavy ringing of the musket stocks upon the ground and the sharp and rapid rattling of the ramrods in their barrels were a kind of relief to Batnahy deadly though he knew the purport of such sounds to be When this was done other commands were given and the soldiers instantaneously formed in single file all round the house and stables completely encircling them in every part at a distance perhaps of some half dozen yards at least that seemed in Barnaby s eyes to be about the space left between himself and those who confronted him The horsemen remained drawn up by themselves as before The two gentlemen in private clothes who had kept aloof now rode forward one on either side the officer The proclamation having been produced and read by one of them the officer called on Barnaby to surrender He made no answer but stepping within the door before which he had kept guard held his pole crosswise to protect it In the midst of a profound silence he was again called upon to yield Still he offered no reply Indeed he had enough to do to run his eye backward and forward along the half dozen men who immediately fronted him and settle hurriedly within himself at which of them he would strike first when they pressed on him He caught the eye of one in the centre and resolved to hew that fellow down though he died for it Again there was a dead silence and again the same voice called upon him to deliver himself up Next moment he was back in the stable dealing blows about him like a madman Two of the men lay stretched at his feet the one he had marked dropped first he had a thought for that even in the hot blood and hurry of the struggle Another blow another Down mastered wounded in the breast by a heavy blow from the butt end of a gun he saw the weapon in the act of falling breathless and a prisoner An exclamation of surprise from the officer recalled him in some degree to himself He looked round Grip after working in secret all the afternoon and with redoubled vigour while everybody s attention was distracted had plucked away the straw from Hugh s bed and turned up the loose ground with his iron bill The hole had been recklessly filled to the brim and was merely sprinkled with earth Golden cups spoons candlesticks coined guineas all the riches were revealed They brought spades and a sack dug up everything that was hidden there and carried away more than two men could lift They handcuffed him and bound his arms searched him and took away all he had Nobody questioned or reproached him or seemed to have much curiosity about him The two men he had stunned were carried off by their companions in the same business like way in which everything else was done Finally he was left under a guard of four soldiers with fixed bayonets while the officer directed in person the search of the house and the other buildings connected with it This was soon completed The soldiers formed again in the yard he was marched out with his guard about him and ordered to fall in where a space was left The others closed up all round and so they moved away with the prisoner in the centre When they came into the streets he felt he was a sight and looking up as they passed quickly along could see people running to the windows a little too late and throwing up the sashes to look after him Sometimes he met a staring face beyond the heads about him or under the arms of his conductors or peering down upon him from a waggon top or coach box but this was all he saw being surrounded by so many men The very noises of the streets seemed muffled and subdued and the air came stale and hot upon him like the sickly breath of an oven Tramp tramp Tramp tramp Heads erect shoulders square every man stepping in exact time all so orderly and regular nobody looking at him nobody seeming conscious of his presence he could hardly believe he was a Prisoner But at the word though only thought not spoken he felt the handcuffs galling his wrists the cord pressing his arms to his sides the loaded guns levelled at his head and those cold bright sharp shining points turned towards him the mere looking down at which now that he was bound and helpless made the warm current of his life run cold Chapter 58 They were not long in reaching the barracks for the officer who commanded the party was desirous to avoid rousing the people by the display of military force in the streets and was humanely anxious to give as little opportunity as possible for any attempt at rescue knowing that it must lead to bloodshed and loss of life and that if the civil authorities by whom he was accompanied empowered him to order his men to fire many innocent persons would probably fall whom curiosity or idleness had attracted to the spot He therefore led the party briskly on avoiding with a merciful prudence the more public and crowded thoroughfares and pursuing those which he deemed least likely to be infested by disorderly persons This wise proceeding not only enabled them to gain their quarters without any interruption but completely baffled a body of rioters who had assembled in one of the main streets through which it was considered certain they would pass and who remained gathered together for the purpose of releasing the prisoner from their hands long after they had deposited him in a place of security closed the barrack gates and set a double guard at every entrance for its better protection Arrived at this place poor Barnaby was marched into a stone floored room where there was a very powerful smell of tobacco a strong thorough draught of air and a great wooden bedstead large enough for a score of men Several soldiers in undress were lounging about or eating from tin cans military accoutrements dangled on rows of pegs along the whitewashed wall and some half dozen men lay fast asleep upon their backs snoring in concert After remaining here just long enough to note these things he was marched out again and conveyed across the parade ground to another portion of the building Perhaps a man never sees so much at a glance as when he is in a situation of extremity The chances are a hundred to one that if Barnaby had lounged in at the gate to look about him he would have lounged out again with a very imperfect idea of the place and would have remembered very little about it But as he was taken handcuffed across the gravelled area nothing escaped his notice The dry arid look of the dusty square and of the bare brick building the clothes hanging at some of the windows and the men in their shirt sleeves and braces lolling with half their bodies out of the others the green sun blinds at the officers quarters and the little scanty trees in front the drummer boys practising in a distant courtyard the men at drill on the parade the two soldiers carrying a basket between them who winked to each other as he went by and slily pointed to their throats the spruce serjeant who hurried past with a cane in his hand and under his arm a clasped book with a vellum cover the fellows in the ground floor rooms furbishing and brushing up their different articles of dress who stopped to look at him and whose voices as they spoke together echoed loudly through the empty galleries and passages everything down to the stand of muskets before the guard house and the drum with a pipe clayed belt attached in one corner impressed itself upon his observation as though he had noticed them in the same place a hundred times or had been a whole day among them in place of one brief hurried minute He was taken into a small paved back yard and there they opened a great door plated with iron and pierced some five feet above the ground with a few holes to let in air and light Into this dungeon he was walked straightway and having locked him up there and placed a sentry over him they left him to his meditations The cell or black hole for it had those words painted on the door was very dark and having recently accommodated a drunken deserter by no means clean Barnaby felt his way to some straw at the farther end and looking towards the door tried to accustom himself to the gloom which coming from the bright sunshine out of doors was not an easy task There was a kind of portico or colonnade outside and this obstructed even the little light that at the best could have found its way through the small apertures in the door The footsteps of the sentinel echoed monotonously as he paced its stone pavement to and fro reminding Barnaby of the watch he had so lately kept himself and as he passed and repassed the door he made the cell for an instant so black by the interposition of his body that his going away again seemed like the appearance of a new ray of light and was quite a circumstance to look for When the prisoner had sat sometime upon the ground gazing at the chinks and listening to the advancing and receding footsteps of his guard the man stood still upon his post Barnaby quite unable to think or to speculate on what would be done with him had been lulled into a kind of doze by his regular pace but his stopping roused him and then he became aware that two men were in conversation under the colonnade and very near the door of his cell How long they had been talking there he could not tell for he had fallen into an unconsciousness of his real position and when the footsteps ceased was answering aloud some question which seemed to have been put to him by Hugh in the stable though of the fancied purport either of question or reply notwithstanding that he awoke with the latter on his lips he had no recollection whatever The first words that reached his ears were these Why is he brought here then if he has to be taken away again so soon Why where would you have him go Damme he s not as safe anywhere as among the king s troops is he What WOULD you do with him Would you hand him over to a pack of cowardly civilians that shake in their shoes till they wear the soles out with trembling at the threats of the ragamuffins he belongs to That s true enough True enough I ll tell you what I wish Tom Green that I was a commissioned instead of a non commissioned officer and that I had the command of two companies only two companies of my own regiment Call me out to stop these riots give me the needful authority and half a dozen rounds of ball cartridge Ay said the other voice That s all very well but they won t give the needful authority If the magistrate won t give the word what s the officer to do Not very well knowing as it seemed how to overcome this difficulty the other man contented himself with damning the magistrates With all my heart said his friend Where s the use of a magistrate returned the other voice What s a magistrate in this case but an impertinent unnecessary unconstitutional sort of interference Here s a proclamation Here s a man referred to in that proclamation Here s proof against him and a witness on the spot Damme Take him out and shoot him sir Who wants a magistrate When does he go before Sir John Fielding asked the man who had spoken first To night at eight o clock returned the other Mark what follows The magistrate commits him to Newgate Our people take him to Newgate The rioters pelt our people Our people retire before the rioters Stones are thrown insults are offered not a shot s fired Why Because of the magistrates Damn the magistrates When he had in some degree relieved his mind by cursing the magistrates in various other forms of speech the man was silent save for a low growling still having reference to those authorities which from time to time escaped him Barnaby who had wit enough to know that this conversation concerned and very nearly concerned himself remained perfectly quiet until they ceased to speak when he groped his way to the door and peeping through the air holes tried to make out what kind of men they were to whom he had been listening The one who condemned the civil power in such strong terms was a serjeant engaged just then as the streaming ribands in his cap announced on the recruiting service He stood leaning sideways against a pillar nearly opposite the door and as he growled to himself drew figures on the pavement with his cane The other man had his back towards the dungeon and Barnaby could only see his form To judge from that he was a gallant manly handsome fellow but he had lost his left arm It had been taken off between the elbow and the shoulder and his empty coat sleeve hung across his breast It was probably this circumstance which gave him an interest beyond any that his companion could boast of and attracted Barnaby s attention There was something soldierly in his bearing and he wore a jaunty cap and jacket Perhaps he had been in the service at one time or other If he had it could not have been very long ago for he was but a young fellow now Well well he said thoughtfully let the fault be where it may it makes a man sorrowful to come back to old England and see her in this condition I suppose the pigs will join em next said the serjeant with an imprecation on the rioters now that the birds have set em the example The birds repeated Tom Green Ah birds said the serjeant testily that s English an t it I don t know what you mean Go to the guard house and see You ll find a bird there that s got their cry as pat as any of em and bawls No Popery like a man or like a devil as he says he is I shouldn t wonder The devil s loose in London somewhere Damme if I wouldn t twist his neck round on the chance if I had MY way The young man had taken two or three steps away as if to go and see this creature when he was arrested by the voice of Barnaby It s mine he called out half laughing and half weeping my pet my friend Grip Ha ha ha Don t hurt him he has done no harm I taught him it s my fault Let me have him if you please He s the only friend I have left now He ll not dance or talk or whistle for you I know but he will for me because he knows me and loves me though you wouldn t think it very well You wouldn t hurt a bird I m sure You re a brave soldier sir and wouldn t harm a woman or a child no no nor a poor bird I m certain This latter adjuration was addressed to the serjeant whom Barnaby judged from his red coat to be high in office and able to seal Grip s destiny by a word But that gentleman in reply surlily damned him for a thief and rebel as he was and with many disinterested imprecations on his own eyes liver blood and body assured him that if it rested with him to decide he would put a final stopper on the bird and his master too You talk boldly to a caged man said Barnaby in anger If I was on the other side of the door and there were none to part us you d change your note ay you may toss your head you would Kill the bird do Kill anything you can and so revenge yourself on those who with their bare hands untied could do as much to you Having vented his defiance he flung himself into the furthest corner of his prison and muttering Good bye Grip good bye dear old Grip shed tears for the first time since he had been taken captive and hid his face in the straw He had had some fancy at first that the one armed man would help him or would give him a kind word in answer He hardly knew why but he hoped and thought so The young fellow had stopped when he called out and checking himself in the very act of turning round stood listening to every word he said Perhaps he built his feeble trust on this perhaps on his being young and having a frank and honest manner However that might be he built on sand The other went away directly he had finished speaking and neither answered him nor returned No matter They were all against him here he might have known as much Good bye old Grip good bye After some time they came and unlocked the door and called to him to come out He rose directly and complied for he would not have THEM think he was subdued or frightened He walked out like a man and looked from face to face None of them returned his gaze or seemed to notice it They marched him back to the parade by the way they had brought him and there they halted among a body of soldiers at least twice as numerous as that which had taken him prisoner in the afternoon The officer he had seen before bade him in a few brief words take notice that if he attempted to escape no matter how favourable a chance he might suppose he had certain of the men had orders to fire upon him that moment They then closed round him as before and marched him off again In the same unbroken order they arrived at Bow Street followed and beset on all sides by a crowd which was continually increasing Here he was placed before a blind gentleman and asked if he wished to say anything Not he What had he got to tell them After a very little talking which he was careless of and quite indifferent to they told him he was to go to Newgate and took him away He went out into the street so surrounded and hemmed in on every side by soldiers that he could see nothing but he knew there was a great crowd of people by the murmur and that they were not friendly to the soldiers was soon rendered evident by their yells and hisses How often and how eagerly he listened for the voice of Hugh There was not a voice he knew among them all Was Hugh a prisoner too Was there no hope As they came nearer and nearer to the prison the hootings of the people grew more violent stones were thrown and every now and then a rush was made against the soldiers which they staggered under One of them close before him smarting under a blow upon the temple levelled his musket but the officer struck it upwards with his sword and ordered him on peril of his life to desist This was the last thing he saw with any distinctness for directly afterwards he was tossed about and beaten to and fro as though in a tempestuous sea But go where he would there were the same guards about him Twice or thrice he was thrown down and so were they but even then he could not elude their vigilance for a moment They were up again and had closed about him before he with his wrists so tightly bound could scramble to his feet Fenced in thus he felt himself hoisted to the top of a low flight of steps and then for a moment he caught a glimpse of the fighting in the crowd and of a few red coats sprinkled together here and there struggling to rejoin their fellows Next moment everything was dark and gloomy and he was standing in the prison lobby the centre of a group of men A smith was speedily in attendance who riveted upon him a set of heavy irons Stumbling on as well as he could beneath the unusual burden of these fetters he was conducted to a strong stone cell where fastening the door with locks and bolts and chains they left him well secured having first unseen by him thrust in Grip who with his head drooping and his deep black plumes rough and rumpled appeared to comprehend and to partake his master s fallen fortunes Chapter 59 It is necessary at this juncture to return to Hugh who having as we have seen called to the rioters to disperse from about the Warren and meet again as usual glided back into the darkness from which he had emerged and reappeared no more that night He paused in the copse which sheltered him from the observation of his mad companions and waited to ascertain whether they drew off at his bidding or still lingered and called to him to join them Some few he saw were indisposed to go away without him and made towards the spot where he stood concealed as though they were about to follow in his footsteps and urge him to come back but these men being in their turn called to by their friends and in truth not greatly caring to venture into the dark parts of the grounds where they might be easily surprised and taken if any of the neighbours or retainers of the family were watching them from among the trees soon abandoned the idea and hastily assembling such men as they found of their mind at the moment straggled off When he was satisfied that the great mass of the insurgents were imitating this example and that the ground was rapidly clearing he plunged into the thickest portion of the little wood and crashing the branches as he went made straight towards a distant light guided by that and by the sullen glow of the fire behind him As he drew nearer and nearer to the twinkling beacon towards which he bent his course the red glare of a few torches began to reveal itself and the voices of men speaking together in a subdued tone broke the silence which save for a distant shouting now and then already prevailed At length he cleared the wood and springing across a ditch stood in a dark lane where a small body of ill looking vagabonds whom he had left there some twenty minutes before waited his coming with impatience They were gathered round an old post chaise or chariot driven by one of themselves who sat postilion wise upon the near horse The blinds were drawn up and Mr Tappertit and Dennis kept guard at the two windows The former assumed the command of the party for he challenged Hugh as he advanced towards them and when he did so those who were resting on the ground about the carriage rose to their feet and clustered round him Well said Simon in a low voice is all right Right enough replied Hugh in the same tone They re dispersing now had begun before I came away And is the coast clear Clear enough before our men I take it said Hugh There are not many who knowing of their work over yonder will want to meddle with em to night Who s got some drink here Everybody had some plunder from the cellar half a dozen flasks and bottles were offered directly He selected the largest and putting it to his mouth sent the wine gurgling down his throat Having emptied it he threw it down and stretched out his hand for another which he emptied likewise at a draught Another was given him and this he half emptied too Reserving what remained to finish with he asked Have you got anything to eat any of you I m as ravenous as a hungry wolf Which of you was in the larder come I was brother said Dennis pulling off his hat and fumbling in the crown There s a matter of cold venison pasty somewhere or another here if that ll do Do cried Hugh seating himself on the pathway Bring it out Quick Show a light here and gather round Let me sup in state my lads Ha ha ha Entering into his boisterous humour for they all had drunk deeply and were as wild as he they crowded about him while two of their number who had torches held them up one on either side of him that his banquet might not be despatched in the dark Mr Dennis having by this time succeeded in extricating from his hat a great mass of pasty which had been wedged in so tightly that it was not easily got out put it before him and Hugh having borrowed a notched and jagged knife from one of the company fell to work upon it vigorously I should recommend you to swallow a little fire every day about an hour afore dinner brother said Dennis after a pause It seems to agree with you and to stimulate your appetite Hugh looked at him and at the blackened faces by which he was surrounded and stopping for a moment to flourish his knife above his head answered with a roar of laughter Keep order there will you said Simon Tappertit Why isn t a man allowed to regale himself noble captain retorted his lieutenant parting the men who stood between them with his knife that he might see him to regale himself a little bit after such work as mine What a hard captain What a strict captain What a tyrannical captain Ha ha ha I wish one of you fellers would hold a bottle to his mouth to keep him quiet said Simon unless you want the military to be down upon us And what if they are down upon us retorted Hugh Who cares Who s afraid Let em come I say let em come The more the merrier Give me bold Barnaby at my side and we two will settle the military without troubling any of you Barnaby s the man for the military Barnaby s health But as the majority of those present were by no means anxious for a second engagement that night being already weary and exhausted they sided with Mr Tappertit and pressed him to make haste with his supper for they had already delayed too long Knowing even in the height of his frenzy that they incurred great danger by lingering so near the scene of the late outrages Hugh made an end of his meal without more remonstrance and rising stepped up to Mr Tappertit and smote him on the back Now then he cried I m ready There are brave birds inside this cage eh Delicate birds tender loving little doves I caged em I caged em one more peep He thrust the little man aside as he spoke and mounting on the steps which were half let down pulled down the blind by force and stared into the chaise like an ogre into his larder Ha ha ha and did you scratch and pinch and struggle pretty mistress he cried as he grasped a little hand that sought in vain to free itself from his grip you so bright eyed and cherry lipped and daintily made But I love you better for it mistress Ay I do You should stab me and welcome so that it pleased you and you had to cure me afterwards I love to see you proud and scornful It makes you handsomer than ever and who so handsome as you at any time my pretty one Come said Mr Tappertit who had waited during this speech with considerable impatience There s enough of that Come down The little hand seconded this admonition by thrusting Hugh s great head away with all its force and drawing up the blind amidst his noisy laughter and vows that he must have another look for the last glimpse of that sweet face had provoked him past all bearing However as the suppressed impatience of the party now broke out into open murmurs he abandoned this design and taking his seat upon the bar contented himself with tapping at the front windows of the carriage and trying to steal a glance inside Mr Tappertit mounting the steps and hanging on by the door issued his directions to the driver with a commanding voice and attitude the rest got up behind or ran by the side of the carriage as they could some in imitation of Hugh endeavoured to see the face he had praised so highly and were reminded of their impertinence by hints from the cudgel of Mr Tappertit Thus they pursued their journey by circuitous and winding roads preserving except when they halted to take breath or to quarrel about the best way of reaching London pretty good order and tolerable silence In the mean time Dolly beautiful bewitching captivating little Dolly her hair dishevelled her dress torn her dark eyelashes wet with tears her bosom heaving her face now pale with fear now crimsoned with indignation her whole self a hundred times more beautiful in this heightened aspect than ever she had been before vainly strove to comfort Emma Haredale and to impart to her the consolation of which she stood in so much need herself The soldiers were sure to come they must be rescued it would be impossible to convey them through the streets of London when they set the threats of their guards at defiance and shrieked to the passengers for help If they did this when they came into the more frequented ways she was certain she was quite certain they must be released So poor Dolly said and so poor Dolly tried to think but the invariable conclusion of all such arguments was that Dolly burst into tears cried as she wrung her hands what would they do or think or who would comfort them at home at the Golden Key and sobbed most piteously Miss Haredale whose feelings were usually of a quieter kind than Dolly s and not so much upon the surface was dreadfully alarmed and indeed had only just recovered from a swoon She was very pale and the hand which Dolly held was quite cold but she bade her nevertheless remember that under Providence much must depend upon their own discretion that if they remained quiet and lulled the vigilance of the ruffians into whose hands they had fallen the chances of their being able to procure assistance when they reached the town were very much increased that unless society were quite unhinged a hot pursuit must be immediately commenced and that her uncle she might be sure would never rest until he had found them out and rescued them But as she said these latter words the idea that he had fallen in a general massacre of the Catholics that night no very wild or improbable supposition after what they had seen and undergone struck her dumb and lost in the horrors they had witnessed and those they might be yet reserved for she sat incapable of thought or speech or outward show of grief as rigid and almost as white and cold as marble Oh how many many times in that long ride did Dolly think of her old lover poor fond slighted Joe How many many times did she recall that night when she ran into his arms from the very man now projecting his hateful gaze into the darkness where she sat and leering through the glass in monstrous admiration And when she thought of Joe and what a brave fellow he was and how he would have rode boldly up and dashed in among these villains now yes though they were double the number and here she clenched her little hand and pressed her foot upon the ground the pride she felt for a moment in having won his heart faded in a burst of tears and she sobbed more bitterly than ever As the night wore on and they proceeded by ways which were quite unknown to them for they could recognise none of the objects of which they sometimes caught a hurried glimpse their fears increased nor were they without good foundation it was not difficult for two beautiful young women to find in their being borne they knew not whither by a band of daring villains who eyed them as some among these fellows did reasons for the worst alarm When they at last entered London by a suburb with which they were wholly unacquainted it was past midnight and the streets were dark and empty Nor was this the worst for the carriage stopping in a lonely spot Hugh suddenly opened the door jumped in and took his seat between them It was in vain they cried for help He put his arm about the neck of each and swore to stifle them with kisses if they were not as silent as the grave I come here to keep you quiet he said and that s the means I shall take So don t be quiet pretty mistresses make a noise do and I shall like it all the better They were proceeding at a rapid pace and apparently with fewer attendants than before though it was so dark the torches being extinguished that this was mere conjecture They shrunk from his touch each into the farthest corner of the carriage but shrink as Dolly would his arm encircled her waist and held her fast She neither cried nor spoke for terror and disgust deprived her of the power but she plucked at his hand as though she would die in the effort to disengage herself and crouching on the ground with her head averted and held down repelled him with a strength she wondered at as much as he The carriage stopped again Lift this one out said Hugh to the man who opened the door as he took Miss Haredale s hand and felt how heavily it fell She s fainted So much the better growled Dennis it was that amiable gentleman She s quiet I always like em to faint unless they re very tender and composed Can you take her by yourself asked Hugh I don t know till I try I ought to be able to I ve lifted up a good many in my time said the hangman Up then She s no small weight brother none of these here fine gals are Up again Now we have her Having by this time hoisted the young lady into his arms he staggered off with his burden Look ye pretty bird said Hugh drawing Dolly towards him Remember what I told you a kiss for every cry Scream if you love me darling Scream once mistress Pretty mistress only once if you love me Thrusting his face away with all her force and holding down her head Dolly submitted to be carried out of the chaise and borne after Miss Haredale into a miserable cottage where Hugh after hugging her to his breast set her gently down upon the floor Poor Dolly Do what she would she only looked the better for it and tempted them the more When her eyes flashed angrily and her ripe lips slightly parted to give her rapid breathing vent who could resist it When she wept and sobbed as though her heart would break and bemoaned her miseries in the sweetest voice that ever fell upon a listener s ear who could be insensible to the little winning pettishness which now and then displayed itself even in the sincerity and earnestness of her grief When forgetful for a moment of herself as she was now she fell on her knees beside her friend and bent over her and laid her cheek to hers and put her arms about her what mortal eyes could have avoided wandering to the delicate bodice the streaming hair the neglected dress the perfect abandonment and unconsciousness of the blooming little beauty Who could look on and see her lavish caresses and endearments and not desire to be in Emma Haredale s place to be either her or Dolly either the hugging or the hugged Not Hugh Not Dennis I tell you what it is young women said Mr Dennis I an t much of a lady s man myself nor am I a party in the present business further than lending a willing hand to my friends but if I see much more of this here sort of thing I shall become a principal instead of a accessory I tell you candid Why have you brought us here said Emma Are we to be murdered Murdered cried Dennis sitting down upon a stool and regarding her with great favour Why my dear who d murder sich chickabiddies as you If you was to ask me now whether you was brought here to be married there might be something in it And here he exchanged a grin with Hugh who removed his eyes from Dolly for the purpose No no said Dennis there ll be no murdering my pets Nothing of that sort Quite the contrairy You are an older man than your companion sir said Emma trembling Have you no pity for us Do you not consider that we are women I do indeed my dear retorted Dennis It would be very hard not to with two such specimens afore my eyes Ha ha Oh yes I consider that We all consider that miss He shook his head waggishly leered at Hugh again and laughed very much as if he had said a noble thing and rather thought he was coming out There ll be no murdering my dear Not a bit on it I tell you what though brother said Dennis cocking his hat for the convenience of scratching his head and looking gravely at Hugh it s worthy of notice as a proof of the amazing equalness and dignity of our law that it don t make no distinction between men and women I ve heerd the judge say sometimes to a highwayman or housebreaker as had tied the ladies neck and heels you ll excuse me making mention of it my darlings and put em in a cellar that he showed no consideration to women Now I say that there judge didn t know his business brother and that if I had been that there highwayman or housebreaker I should have made answer What are you a talking of my lord I showed the women as much consideration as the law does and what more would you have me do If you was to count up in the newspapers the number of females as have been worked off in this here city alone in the last ten year said Mr Dennis thoughtfully you d be surprised at the total quite amazed you would There s a dignified and equal thing a beautiful thing But we ve no security for its lasting Now that they ve begun to favour these here Papists I shouldn t wonder if they went and altered even THAT one of these days Upon my soul I shouldn t The subject perhaps from being of too exclusive and professional a nature failed to interest Hugh as much as his friend had anticipated But he had no time to pursue it for at this crisis Mr Tappertit entered precipitately at sight of whom Dolly uttered a scream of joy and fairly threw herself into his arms I knew it I was sure of it cried Dolly My dear father s at the door Thank God thank God Bless you Sim Heaven bless you for this Simon Tappertit who had at first implicitly believed that the locksmith s daughter unable any longer to suppress her secret passion for himself was about to give it full vent in its intensity and to declare that she was his for ever looked extremely foolish when she said these words the more so as they were received by Hugh and Dennis with a loud laugh which made her draw back and regard him with a fixed and earnest look Miss Haredale said Sim after a very awkward silence I hope you re as comfortable as circumstances will permit of Dolly Varden my darling my own my lovely one I hope YOU RE pretty comfortable likewise Poor little Dolly She saw how it was hid her face in her hands and sobbed more bitterly than ever You meet in me Miss V said Simon laying his hand upon his breast not a prentice not a workman not a slave not the wictim of your father s tyrannical behaviour but the leader of a great people the captain of a noble band in which these gentlemen are as I may say corporals and serjeants You behold in me not a private individual but a public character not a mender of locks but a healer of the wounds of his unhappy country Dolly V sweet Dolly V for how many years have I looked forward to this present meeting For how many years has it been my intention to exalt and ennoble you I redeem it Behold in me your husband Yes beautiful Dolly charmer enslaver S Tappertit is all your own As he said these words he advanced towards her Dolly retreated till she could go no farther and then sank down upon the floor Thinking it very possible that this might be maiden modesty Simon essayed to raise her on which Dolly goaded to desperation wound her hands in his hair and crying out amidst her tears that he was a dreadful little wretch and always had been shook and pulled and beat him until he was fain to call for help most lustily Hugh had never admired her half so much as at that moment She s in an excited state to night said Simon as he smoothed his rumpled feathers and don t know when she s well off Let her be by herself till to morrow and that ll bring her down a little Carry her into the next house Hugh had her in his arms directly It might be that Mr Tappertit s heart was really softened by her distress or it might be that he felt it in some degree indecorous that his intended bride should be struggling in the grasp of another man He commanded him on second thoughts to put her down again and looked moodily on as she flew to Miss Haredale s side and clinging to her dress hid her flushed face in its folds They shall remain here together till to morrow said Simon who had now quite recovered his dignity till to morrow Come away Ay cried Hugh Come away captain Ha ha ha What are you laughing at demanded Simon sternly Nothing captain nothing Hugh rejoined and as he spoke and clapped his hand upon the shoulder of the little man he laughed again for some unknown reason with tenfold violence Mr Tappertit surveyed him from head to foot with lofty scorn this only made him laugh the more and turning to the prisoners said You ll take notice ladies that this place is well watched on every side and that the least noise is certain to be attended with unpleasant consequences You ll hear both of you more of our intentions to morrow In the mean time don t show yourselves at the window or appeal to any of the people you may see pass it for if you do it ll be known directly that you come from a Catholic house and all the exertions our men can make may not be able to save your lives With this last caution which was true enough he turned to the door followed by Hugh and Dennis They paused for a moment going out to look at them clasped in each other s arms and then left the cottage fastening the door and setting a good watch upon it and indeed all round the house I say growled Dennis as they walked away in company that s a dainty pair Muster Gashford s one is as handsome as the other eh Hush said Hugh hastily Don t you mention names It s a bad habit I wouldn t like to be HIM then as you don t like names when he breaks it out to her that s all said Dennis She s one of them fine black eyed proud gals as I wouldn t trust at such times with a knife too near em I ve seen some of that sort afore now I recollect one that was worked off many year ago and there was a gentleman in that case too that says to me with her lip a trembling but her hand as steady as ever I see one Dennis I m near my end but if I had a dagger in these fingers and he was within my reach I d strike him dead afore me ah she did and she d have done it too Strike who dead demanded Hugh How should I know brother answered Dennis SHE never said not she Hugh looked for a moment as though he would have made some further inquiry into this incoherent recollection but Simon Tappertit who had been meditating deeply gave his thoughts a new direction Hugh said Sim You have done well to day You shall be rewarded So have you Dennis There s no young woman YOU want to carry off is there N no returned that gentleman stroking his grizzly beard which was some two inches long None in partickler I think Very good said Sim then we ll find some other way of making it up to you As to you old boy he turned to Hugh you shall have Miggs her that I promised you you know within three days Mind I pass my word for it Hugh thanked him heartily and as he did so his laughing fit returned with such violence that he was obliged to hold his side with one hand and to lean with the other on the shoulder of his small captain without whose support he would certainly have rolled upon the ground Chapter 60 The three worthies turned their faces towards The Boot with the intention of passing the night in that place of rendezvous and of seeking the repose they so much needed in the shelter of their old den for now that the mischief and destruction they had purposed were achieved and their prisoners were safely bestowed for the night they began to be conscious of exhaustion and to feel the wasting effects of the madness which had led to such deplorable results Notwithstanding the lassitude and fatigue which oppressed him now in common with his two companions and indeed with all who had taken an active share in that night s work Hugh s boisterous merriment broke out afresh whenever he looked at Simon Tappertit and vented itself much to that gentleman s indignation in such shouts of laughter as bade fair to bring the watch upon them and involve them in a skirmish to which in their present worn out condition they might prove by no means equal Even Mr Dennis who was not at all particular on the score of gravity or dignity and who had a great relish for his young friend s eccentric humours took occasion to remonstrate with him on this imprudent behaviour which he held to be a species of suicide tantamount to a man s working himself off without being overtaken by the law than which he could imagine nothing more ridiculous or impertinent Not abating one jot of his noisy mirth for these remonstrances Hugh reeled along between them having an arm of each until they hove in sight of The Boot and were within a field or two of that convenient tavern He happened by great good luck to have roared and shouted himself into silence by this time They were proceeding onward without noise when a scout who had been creeping about the ditches all night to warn any stragglers from encroaching further on what was now such dangerous ground peeped cautiously from his hiding place and called to them to stop Stop and why said Hugh Because the scout replied the house was filled with constables and soldiers having been surprised that afternoon The inmates had fled or been taken into custody he could not say which He had prevented a great many people from approaching nearer and he believed they had gone to the markets and such places to pass the night He had seen the distant fires but they were all out now He had heard the people who passed and repassed speaking of them too and could report that the prevailing opinion was one of apprehension and dismay He had not heard a word of Barnaby didn t even know his name but it had been said in his hearing that some man had been taken and carried off to Newgate Whether this was true or false he could not affirm The three took counsel together on hearing this and debated what it might be best to do Hugh deeming it possible that Barnaby was in the hands of the soldiers and at that moment under detention at The Boot was for advancing stealthily and firing the house but his companions who objected to such rash measures unless they had a crowd at their backs represented that if Barnaby were taken he had assuredly been removed to a stronger prison they would never have dreamed of keeping him all night in a place so weak and open to attack Yielding to this reasoning and to their persuasions Hugh consented to turn back and to repair to Fleet Market for which place it seemed a few of their boldest associates had shaped their course on receiving the same intelligence Feeling their strength recruited and their spirits roused now that there was a new necessity for action they hurried away quite forgetful of the fatigue under which they had been sinking but a few minutes before and soon arrived at their new place of destination Fleet Market at that time was a long irregular row of wooden sheds and penthouses occupying the centre of what is now called Farringdon Street They were jumbled together in a most unsightly fashion in the middle of the road to the great obstruction of the thoroughfare and the annoyance of passengers who were fain to make their way as they best could among carts baskets barrows trucks casks bulks and benches and to jostle with porters hucksters waggoners and a motley crowd of buyers sellers pick pockets vagrants and idlers The air was perfumed with the stench of rotten leaves and faded fruit the refuse of the butchers stalls and offal and garbage of a hundred kinds It was indispensable to most public conveniences in those days that they should be public nuisances likewise and Fleet Market maintained the principle to admiration To this place perhaps because its sheds and baskets were a tolerable substitute for beds or perhaps because it afforded the means of a hasty barricade in case of need many of the rioters had straggled not only that night but for two or three nights before It was now broad day but the morning being cold a group of them were gathered round a fire in a public house drinking hot purl and smoking pipes and planning new schemes for to morrow Hugh and his two friends being known to most of these men were received with signal marks of approbation and inducted into the most honourable seats The room door was closed and fastened to keep intruders at a distance and then they proceeded to exchange news The soldiers have taken possession of The Boot I hear said Hugh Who knows anything about it Several cried that they did but the majority of the company having been engaged in the assault upon the Warren and all present having been concerned in one or other of the night s expeditions it proved that they knew no more than Hugh himself having been merely warned by each other or by the scout and knowing nothing of their own knowledge We left a man on guard there to day said Hugh looking round him who is not here You know who it is Barnaby who brought the soldier down at Westminster Has any man seen or heard of him They shook their heads and murmured an answer in the negative as each man looked round and appealed to his fellow when a noise was heard without and a man was heard to say that he wanted Hugh that he must see Hugh He is but one man cried Hugh to those who kept the door let him come in Ay ay muttered the others Let him come in Let him come in The door was accordingly unlocked and opened A one armed man with his head and face tied up with a bloody cloth as though he had been severely beaten his clothes torn and his remaining hand grasping a thick stick rushed in among them and panting for breath demanded which was Hugh Here he is replied the person he inquired for I am Hugh What do you want with me I have a message for you said the man You know one Barnaby What of him Did he send the message Yes He s taken He s in one of the strong cells in Newgate He defended himself as well as he could but was overpowered by numbers That s his message When did you see him asked Hugh hastily On his way to prison where he was taken by a party of soldiers They took a by road and not the one we expected I was one of the few who tried to rescue him and he called to me and told me to tell Hugh where he was We made a good struggle though it failed Look here He pointed to his dress and to his bandaged head and still panting for breath glanced round the room then faced towards Hugh again I know you by sight he said for I was in the crowd on Friday and on Saturday and yesterday but I didn t know your name You re a bold fellow I know So is he He fought like a lion tonight but it was of no use I did my best considering that I want this limb Again he glanced inquisitively round the room or seemed to do so for his face was nearly hidden by the bandage and again facing sharply towards Hugh grasped his stick as if he half expected to be set upon and stood on the defensive If he had any such apprehension however he was speedily reassured by the demeanour of all present None thought of the bearer of the tidings He was lost in the news he brought Oaths threats and execrations were vented on all sides Some cried that if they bore this tamely another day would see them all in jail some that they should have rescued the other prisoners and this would not have happened One man cried in a loud voice Who ll follow me to Newgate and there was a loud shout and general rush towards the door But Hugh and Dennis stood with their backs against it and kept them back until the clamour had so far subsided that their voices could be heard when they called to them together that to go now in broad day would be madness and that if they waited until night and arranged a plan of attack they might release not only their own companions but all the prisoners and burn down the jail Not that jail alone cried Hugh but every jail in London They shall have no place to put their prisoners in We ll burn them all down make bonfires of them every one Here he cried catching at the hangman s hand Let all who re men here join with us Shake hands upon it Barnaby out of jail and not a jail left standing Who joins Every man there And they swore a great oath to release their friends from Newgate next night to force the doors and burn the jail or perish in the fire themselves Chapter 61 On that same night events so crowd upon each other in convulsed and distracted times that more than the stirring incidents of a whole life often become compressed into the compass of four and twenty hours on that same night Mr Haredale having strongly bound his prisoner with the assistance of the sexton and forced him to mount his horse conducted him to Chigwell bent upon procuring a conveyance to London from that place and carrying him at once before a justice The disturbed state of the town would be he knew a sufficient reason for demanding the murderer s committal to prison before daybreak as no man could answer for the security of any of the watch houses or ordinary places of detention and to convey a prisoner through the streets when the mob were again abroad would not only be a task of great danger and hazard but would be to challenge an attempt at rescue Directing the sexton to lead the horse he walked close by the murderer s side and in this order they reached the village about the middle of the night The people were all awake and up for they were fearful of being burnt in their beds and sought to comfort and assure each other by watching in company A few of the stoutest hearted were armed and gathered in a body on the green To these who knew him well Mr Haredale addressed himself briefly narrating what had happened and beseeching them to aid in conveying the criminal to London before the dawn of day But not a man among them dared to help him by so much as the motion of a finger The rioters in their passage through the village had menaced with their fiercest vengeance any person who should aid in extinguishing the fire or render the least assistance to him or any Catholic whomsoever Their threats extended to their lives and all they possessed They were assembled for their own protection and could not endanger themselves by lending any aid to him This they told him not without hesitation and regret as they kept aloof in the moonlight and glanced fearfully at the ghostly rider who with his head drooping on his breast and his hat slouched down upon his brow neither moved nor spoke Finding it impossible to persuade them and indeed hardly knowing how to do so after what they had seen of the fury of the crowd Mr Haredale besought them that at least they would leave him free to act for himself and would suffer him to take the only chaise and pair of horses that the place afforded This was not acceded to without some difficulty but in the end they told him to do what he would and go away from them in heaven s name Leaving the sexton at the horse s bridle he drew out the chaise with his own hands and would have harnessed the horses but that the post boy of the village a soft hearted good for nothing vagabond kind of fellow was moved by his earnestness and passion and throwing down a pitchfork with which he was armed swore that the rioters might cut him into mincemeat if they liked but he would not stand by and see an honest gentleman who had done no wrong reduced to such extremity without doing what he could to help him Mr Haredale shook him warmly by the hand and thanked him from his heart In five minutes time the chaise was ready and this good scapegrace in his saddle The murderer was put inside the blinds were drawn up the sexton took his seat upon the bar Mr Haredale mounted his horse and rode close beside the door and so they started in the dead of night and in profound silence for London The consternation was so extreme that even the horses which had escaped the flames at the Warren could find no friends to shelter them They passed them on the road browsing on the stunted grass and the driver told them that the poor beasts had wandered to the village first but had been driven away lest they should bring the vengeance of the crowd on any of the inhabitants Nor was this feeling confined to such small places where the people were timid ignorant and unprotected When they came near London they met in the grey light of morning more than one poor Catholic family who terrified by the threats and warnings of their neighbours were quitting the city on foot and who told them they could hire no cart or horse for the removal of their goods and had been compelled to leave them behind at the mercy of the crowd Near Mile End they passed a house the master of which a Catholic gentleman of small means having hired a waggon to remove his furniture by midnight had had it all brought down into the street to wait the vehicle s arrival and save time in the packing But the man with whom he made the bargain alarmed by the fires that night and by the sight of the rioters passing his door had refused to keep it and the poor gentleman with his wife and servant and their little children were sitting trembling among their goods in the open street dreading the arrival of day and not knowing where to turn or what to do It was the same they heard with the public conveyances The panic was so great that the mails and stage coaches were afraid to carry passengers who professed the obnoxious religion If the drivers knew them or they admitted that they held that creed they would not take them no though they offered large sums and yesterday people had been afraid to recognise Catholic acquaintance in the streets lest they should be marked by spies and burnt out as it was called in consequence One mild old man a priest whose chapel was destroyed a very feeble patient inoffensive creature who was trudging away alone designing to walk some distance from town and then try his fortune with the coaches told Mr Haredale that he feared he might not find a magistrate who would have the hardihood to commit a prisoner to jail on his complaint But notwithstanding these discouraging accounts they went on and reached the Mansion House soon after sunrise Mr Haredale threw himself from his horse but he had no need to knock at the door for it was already open and there stood upon the step a portly old man with a very red or rather purple face who with an anxious expression of countenance was remonstrating with some unseen personage upstairs while the porter essayed to close the door by degrees and get rid of him With the intense impatience and excitement natural to one in his condition Mr Haredale thrust himself forward and was about to speak when the fat old gentleman interposed My good sir said he pray let me get an answer This is the sixth time I have been here I was here five times yesterday My house is threatened with destruction It is to be burned down to night and was to have been last night but they had other business on their hands Pray let me get an answer My good sir returned Mr Haredale shaking his head my house is burned to the ground But heaven forbid that yours should be Get your answer Be brief in mercy to me Now you hear this my lord said the old gentleman calling up the stairs to where the skirt of a dressing gown fluttered on the landing place Here is a gentleman here whose house was actually burnt down last night Dear me dear me replied a testy voice I am very sorry for it but what am I to do I can t build it up again The chief magistrate of the city can t go and be a rebuilding of people s houses my good sir Stuff and nonsense But the chief magistrate of the city can prevent people s houses from having any need to be rebuilt if the chief magistrate s a man and not a dummy can t he my lord cried the old gentleman in a choleric manner You are disrespectable sir said the Lord Mayor leastways disrespectful I mean Disrespectful my lord returned the old gentleman I was respectful five times yesterday I can t be respectful for ever Men can t stand on being respectful when their houses are going to be burnt over their heads with them in em What am I to do my lord AM I to have any protection I told you yesterday sir said the Lord Mayor that you might have an alderman in your house if you could get one to come What the devil s the good of an alderman returned the choleric old gentleman To awe the crowd sir said the Lord Mayor Oh Lord ha mercy whimpered the old gentleman as he wiped his forehead in a state of ludicrous distress to think of sending an alderman to awe a crowd Why my lord if they were even so many babies fed on mother s milk what do you think they d care for an alderman Will YOU come I said the Lord Mayor most emphatically Certainly not Then what returned the old gentleman what am I to do Am I a citizen of England Am I to have the benefit of the laws Am I to have any return for the King s taxes I don t know I am sure said the Lord Mayor what a pity it is you re a Catholic Why couldn t you be a Protestant and then you wouldn t have got yourself into such a mess I m sure I don t know what s to be done There are great people at the bottom of these riots Oh dear me what a thing it is to be a public character You must look in again in the course of the day Would a javelin man do Or there s Philips the constable HE S disengaged he s not very old for a man at his time of life except in his legs and if you put him up at a window he d look quite young by candle light and might frighten em very much Oh dear well we ll see about it Stop cried Mr Haredale pressing the door open as the porter strove to shut it and speaking rapidly My Lord Mayor I beg you not to go away I have a man here who committed a murder eight and twenty years ago Half a dozen words from me on oath will justify you in committing him to prison for re examination I only seek just now to have him consigned to a place of safety The least delay may involve his being rescued by the rioters Oh dear me cried the Lord Mayor God bless my soul and body oh Lor well I there are great people at the bottom of these riots you know You really mustn t My lord said Mr Haredale the murdered gentleman was my brother I succeeded to his inheritance there were not wanting slanderous tongues at that time to whisper that the guilt of this most foul and cruel deed was mine mine who loved him as he knows in Heaven dearly The time has come after all these years of gloom and misery for avenging him and bringing to light a crime so artful and so devilish that it has no parallel Every second s delay on your part loosens this man s bloody hands again and leads to his escape My lord I charge you hear me and despatch this matter on the instant Oh dear me cried the chief magistrate these an t business hours you know I wonder at you how ungentlemanly it is of you you mustn t you really mustn t And I suppose you are a Catholic too I am said Mr Haredale God bless my soul I believe people turn Catholics a purpose to vex and worrit me cried the Lord Mayor I wish you wouldn t come here they ll be setting the Mansion House afire next and we shall have you to thank for it You must lock your prisoner up sir give him to a watchman and call again at a proper time Then we ll see about it Before Mr Haredale could answer the sharp closing of a door and drawing of its bolts gave notice that the Lord Mayor had retreated to his bedroom and that further remonstrance would be unavailing The two clients retreated likewise and the porter shut them out into the street That s the way he puts me off said the old gentleman I can get no redress and no help What are you going to do sir To try elsewhere answered Mr Haredale who was by this time on horseback I feel for you I assure you and well I may for we are in a common cause said the old gentleman I may not have a house to offer you to night let me tender it while I can On second thoughts though he added putting up a pocket book he had produced while speaking I ll not give you a card for if it was found upon you it might get you into trouble Langdale that s my name vintner and distiller Holborn Hill you re heartily welcome if you ll come Mr Haredale bowed and rode off close beside the chaise as before determining to repair to the house of Sir John Fielding who had the reputation of being a bold and active magistrate and fully resolved in case the rioters should come upon them to do execution on the murderer with his own hands rather than suffer him to be released They arrived at the magistrate s dwelling however without molestation for the mob as we have seen were then intent on deeper schemes and knocked at the door As it had been pretty generally rumoured that Sir John was proscribed by the rioters a body of thief takers had been keeping watch in the house all night To one of them Mr Haredale stated his business which appearing to the man of sufficient moment to warrant his arousing the justice procured him an immediate audience No time was lost in committing the murderer to Newgate then a new building recently completed at a vast expense and considered to be of enormous strength The warrant being made out three of the thief takers bound him afresh he had been struggling it seemed in the chaise and had loosened his manacles gagged him lest they should meet with any of the mob and he should call to them for help and seated themselves along with him in the carriage These men being all well armed made a formidable escort but they drew up the blinds again as though the carriage were empty and directed Mr Haredale to ride forward that he might not attract attention by seeming to belong to it The wisdom of this proceeding was sufficiently obvious for as they hurried through the city they passed among several groups of men who if they had not supposed the chaise to be quite empty would certainly have stopped it But those within keeping quite close and the driver tarrying to be asked no questions they reached the prison without interruption and once there had him out and safe within its gloomy walls in a twinkling With eager eyes and strained attention Mr Haredale saw him chained and locked and barred up in his cell Nay when he had left the jail and stood in the free street without he felt the iron plates upon the doors with his hands and drew them over the stone wall to assure himself that it was real and to exult in its being so strong and rough and cold It was not until he turned his back upon the jail and glanced along the empty streets so lifeless and quiet in the bright morning that he felt the weight upon his heart that he knew he was tortured by anxiety for those he had left at home and that home itself was but another bead in the long rosary of his regrets Chapter 62 The prisoner left to himself sat down upon his bedstead and resting his elbows on his knees and his chin upon his hands remained in that attitude for hours It would be hard to say of what nature his reflections were They had no distinctness and saving for some flashes now and then no reference to his condition or the train of circumstances by which it had been brought about The cracks in the pavement of his cell the chinks in the wall where stone was joined to stone the bars in the window the iron ring upon the floor such things as these subsiding strangely into one another and awakening an indescribable kind of interest and amusement engrossed his whole mind and although at the bottom of his every thought there was an uneasy sense of guilt and dread of death he felt no more than that vague consciousness of it which a sleeper has of pain It pursues him through his dreams gnaws at the heart of all his fancied pleasures robs the banquet of its taste music of its sweetness makes happiness itself unhappy and yet is no bodily sensation but a phantom without shape or form or visible presence pervading everything but having no existence recognisable everywhere but nowhere seen or touched or met with face to face until the sleep is past and waking agony returns After a long time the door of his cell opened He looked up saw the blind man enter and relapsed into his former position Guided by his breathing the visitor advanced to where he sat and stopping beside him and stretching out his hand to assure himself that he was right remained for a good space silent This is bad Rudge This is bad he said at length The prisoner shuffled with his feet upon the ground in turning his body from him but made no other answer How were you taken he asked And where You never told me more than half your secret No matter I know it now How was it and where eh he asked again coming still nearer to him At Chigwell said the other At Chigwell How came you there Because I went there to avoid the man I stumbled on he answered Because I was chased and driven there by him and Fate Because I was urged to go there by something stronger than my own will When I found him watching in the house she used to live in night after night I knew I never could escape him never and when I heard the Bell He shivered muttered that it was very cold paced quickly up and down the narrow cell and sitting down again fell into his old posture You were saying said the blind man after another pause that when you heard the Bell Let it be will you he retorted in a hurried voice It hangs there yet The blind man turned a wistful and inquisitive face towards him but he continued to speak without noticing him I went to Chigwell in search of the mob I have been so hunted and beset by this man that I knew my only hope of safety lay in joining them They had gone on before I followed them when it left off When what left off The Bell They had quitted the place I hoped that some of them might be still lingering among the ruins and was searching for them when I heard he drew a long breath and wiped his forehead with his sleeve his voice Saying what No matter what I don t know I was then at the foot of the turret where I did the Ay said the blind man nodding his head with perfect composure I understand I climbed the stair or so much of it as was left meaning to hide till he had gone But he heard me and followed almost as soon as I set foot upon the ashes You might have hidden in the wall and thrown him down or stabbed him said the blind man Might I Between that man and me was one who led him on I saw it though he did not and raised above his head a bloody hand It was in the room above that HE and I stood glaring at each other on the night of the murder and before he fell he raised his hand like that and fixed his eyes on me I knew the chase would end there You have a strong fancy said the blind man with a smile Strengthen yours with blood and see what it will come to He groaned and rocked himself and looking up for the first time said in a low hollow voice Eight and twenty years Eight and twenty years He has never changed in all that time never grown older nor altered in the least degree He has been before me in the dark night and the broad sunny day in the twilight the moonlight the sunlight the light of fire and lamp and candle and in the deepest gloom Always the same In company in solitude on land on shipboard sometimes leaving me alone for months and sometimes always with me I have seen him at sea come gliding in the dead of night along the bright reflection of the moon in the calm water and I have seen him on quays and market places with his hand uplifted towering the centre of a busy crowd unconscious of the terrible form that had its silent stand among them Fancy Are you real Am I Are these iron fetters riveted on me by the smith s hammer or are they fancies I can shatter at a blow The blind man listened in silence Fancy Do I fancy that I killed him Do I fancy that as I left the chamber where he lay I saw the face of a man peeping from a dark door who plainly showed me by his fearful looks that he suspected what I had done Do I remember that I spoke fairly to him that I drew nearer nearer yet with the hot knife in my sleeve Do I fancy how HE died Did he stagger back into the angle of the wall into which I had hemmed him and bleeding inwardly stand not fail a corpse before me Did I see him for an instant as I see you now erect and on his feet but dead The blind man who knew that he had risen motioned him to sit down again upon his bedstead but he took no notice of the gesture It was then I thought for the first time of fastening the murder upon him It was then I dressed him in my clothes and dragged him down the back stairs to the piece of water Do I remember listening to the bubbles that came rising up when I had rolled him in Do I remember wiping the water from my face and because the body splashed it there in its descent feeling as if it MUST be blood Did I go home when I had done And oh my God how long it took to do Did I stand before my wife and tell her Did I see her fall upon the ground and when I stooped to raise her did she thrust me back with a force that cast me off as if I had been a child staining the hand with which she clasped my wrist Is THAT fancy Did she go down upon her knees and call on Heaven to witness that she and her unborn child renounced me from that hour and did she in words so solemn that they turned me cold me fresh from the horrors my own hands had made warn me to fly while there was time for though she would be silent being my wretched wife she would not shelter me Did I go forth that night abjured of God and man and anchored deep in hell to wander at my cable s length about the earth and surely be drawn down at last Why did you return said the blind man Why is blood red I could no more help it than I could live without breath I struggled against the impulse but I was drawn back through every difficult and adverse circumstance as by a mighty engine Nothing could stop me The day and hour were none of my choice Sleeping and waking I had been among the old haunts for years had visited my own grave Why did I come back Because this jail was gaping for me and he stood beckoning at the door You were not known said the blind man I was a man who had been twenty two years dead No I was not known You should have kept your secret better MY secret MINE It was a secret any breath of air could whisper at its will The stars had it in their twinkling the water in its flowing the leaves in their rustling the seasons in their return It lurked in strangers faces and their voices Everything had lips on which it always trembled MY secret It was revealed by your own act at any rate said the blind man The act was not mine I did it but it was not mine I was forced at times to wander round and round and round that spot If you had chained me up when the fit was on me I should have broken away and gone there As truly as the loadstone draws iron towards it so he lying at the bottom of his grave could draw me near him when he would Was that fancy Did I like to go there or did I strive and wrestle with the power that forced me The blind man shrugged his shoulders and smiled incredulously The prisoner again resumed his old attitude and for a long time both were mute I suppose then said his visitor at length breaking silence that you are penitent and resigned that you desire to make peace with everybody in particular with your wife who has brought you to this and that you ask no greater favour than to be carried to Tyburn as soon as possible That being the case I had better take my leave I am not good enough to be company for you Have I not told you said the other fiercely that I have striven and wrestled with the power that brought me here Has my whole life for eight and twenty years been one perpetual struggle and resistance and do you think I want to lie down and die Do all men shrink from death I most of all That s better said That s better spoken Rudge but I ll not call you that again than anything you have said yet returned the blind man speaking more familiarly and laying his hands upon his arm Lookye I never killed a man myself for I have never been placed in a position that made it worth my while Farther I am not an advocate for killing men and I don t think I should recommend it or like it for it s very hazardous under any circumstances But as you had the misfortune to get into this trouble before I made your acquaintance and as you have been my companion and have been of use to me for a long time now I overlook that part of the matter and am only anxious that you shouldn t die unnecessarily Now I do not consider that at present it is at all necessary What else is left me returned the prisoner To eat my way through these walls with my teeth Something easier than that returned his friend Promise me that you will talk no more of these fancies of yours idle foolish things quite beneath a man and I ll tell you what I mean Tell me said the other Your worthy lady with the tender conscience your scrupulous virtuous punctilious but not blindly affectionate wife What of her Is now in London A curse upon her be she where she may That s natural enough If she had taken her annuity as usual you would not have been here and we should have been better off But that s apart from the business She s in London Scared as I suppose and have no doubt by my representation when I waited upon her that you were close at hand which I of course urged only as an inducement to compliance knowing that she was not pining to see you she left that place and travelled up to London How do you know From my friend the noble captain the illustrious general the bladder Mr Tappertit I learnt from him the last time I saw him which was yesterday that your son who is called Barnaby not after his father I suppose Death does that matter now You are impatient said the blind man calmly it s a good sign and looks like life that your son Barnaby had been lured away from her by one of his companions who knew him of old at Chigwell and that he is now among the rioters And what is that to me If father and son be hanged together what comfort shall I find in that Stay stay my friend returned the blind man with a cunning look you travel fast to journeys ends Suppose I track my lady out and say thus much You want your son ma am good I knowing those who tempt him to remain among them can restore him to you ma am good You must pay a price ma am for his restoration good again The price is small and easy to be paid dear ma am that s best of all What mockery is this Very likely she may reply in those words No mockery at all I answer Madam a person said to be your husband identity is difficult of proof after the lapse of many years is in prison his life in peril the charge against him murder Now ma am your husband has been dead a long long time The gentleman never can be confounded with him if you will have the goodness to say a few words on oath as to when he died and how and that this person who I am told resembles him in some degree is no more he than I am Such testimony will set the question quite at rest Pledge yourself to me to give it ma am and I will undertake to keep your son a fine lad out of harm s way until you have done this trifling service when he shall he delivered up to you safe and sound On the other hand if you decline to do so I fear he will be betrayed and handed over to the law which will assuredly sentence him to suffer death It is in fact a choice between his life and death If you refuse he swings If you comply the timber is not grown nor the hemp sown that shall do him any harm There is a gleam of hope in this cried the prisoner A gleam returned his friend a noon blaze a full and glorious daylight Hush I hear the tread of distant feet Rely on me When shall I hear more As soon as I do I should hope to morrow They are coming to say that our time for talk is over I hear the jingling of the keys Not another word of this just now or they may overhear us As he said these words the lock was turned and one of the prison turnkeys appearing at the door announced that it was time for visitors to leave the jail So soon said Stagg meekly But it can t be helped Cheer up friend This mistake will soon be set at rest and then you are a man again If this charitable gentleman will lead a blind man who has nothing in return but prayers to the prison porch and set him with his face towards the west he will do a worthy deed Thank you good sir I thank you very kindly So saying and pausing for an instant at the door to turn his grinning face towards his friend he departed When the officer had seen him to the porch he returned and again unlocking and unbarring the door of the cell set it wide open informing its inmate that he was at liberty to walk in the adjacent yard if he thought proper for an hour The prisoner answered with a sullen nod and being left alone again sat brooding over what he had heard and pondering upon the hopes the recent conversation had awakened gazing abstractedly the while he did so on the light without and watching the shadows thrown by one wall on another and on the stone paved ground It was a dull square yard made cold and gloomy by high walls and seeming to chill the very sunlight The stone so bare and rough and obdurate filled even him with longing thoughts of meadow land and trees and with a burning wish to be at liberty As he looked he rose and leaning against the door post gazed up at the bright blue sky smiling even on that dreary home of crime He seemed for a moment to remember lying on his back in some sweet scented place and gazing at it through moving branches long ago His attention was suddenly attracted by a clanking sound he knew what it was for he had startled himself by making the same noise in walking to the door Presently a voice began to sing and he saw the shadow of a figure on the pavement It stopped was silent all at once as though the person for a moment had forgotten where he was but soon remembered and so with the same clanking noise the shadow disappeared He walked out into the court and paced it to and fro startling the echoes as he went with the harsh jangling of his fetters There was a door near his which like his stood ajar He had not taken half a dozen turns up and down the yard when standing still to observe this door he heard the clanking sound again A face looked out of the grated window he saw it very dimly for the cell was dark and the bars were heavy and directly afterwards a man appeared and came towards him For the sense of loneliness he had he might have been in jail a year Made eager by the hope of companionship he quickened his pace and hastened to meet the man half way What was this His son They stood face to face staring at each other He shrinking and cowed despite himself Barnahy struggling with his imperfect memory and wondering where he had seen that face before He was not uncertain long for suddenly he laid hands upon him and striving to bear him to the ground cried Ah I know You are the robber He said nothing in reply at first but held down his head and struggled with him silently Finding the younger man too strong for him he raised his face looked close into his eyes and said I am your father God knows what magic the name had for his ears but Barnaby released his hold fell back and looked at him aghast Suddenly he sprung towards him put his arms about his neck and pressed his head against his cheek Yes yes he was he was sure he was But where had he been so long and why had he left his mother by herself or worse than by herself with her poor foolish boy And had she really been as happy as they said And where was she Was she near there She was not happy now and he in jail Ah no Not a word was said in answer but Grip croaked loudly and hopped about them round and round as if enclosing them in a magic circle and invoking all the powers of mischief Chapter 63 During the whole of this day every regiment in or near the metropolis was on duty in one or other part of the town and the regulars and militia in obedience to the orders which were sent to every barrack and station within twenty four hours journey began to pour in by all the roads But the disturbance had attained to such a formidable height and the rioters had grown with impunity to be so audacious that the sight of this great force continually augmented by new arrivals instead of operating as a check stimulated them to outrages of greater hardihood than any they had yet committed and helped to kindle a flame in London the like of which had never been beheld even in its ancient and rebellious times All yesterday and on this day likewise the commander in chief endeavoured to arouse the magistrates to a sense of their duty and in particular the Lord Mayor who was the faintest hearted and most timid of them all With this object large bodies of the soldiery were several times despatched to the Mansion House to await his orders but as he could by no threats or persuasions be induced to give any and as the men remained in the open street fruitlessly for any good purpose and thrivingly for a very bad one these laudable attempts did harm rather than good For the crowd becoming speedily acquainted with the Lord Mayor s temper did not fail to take advantage of it by boasting that even the civil authorities were opposed to the Papists and could not find it in their hearts to molest those who were guilty of no other offence These vaunts they took care to make within the hearing of the soldiers and they being naturally loth to quarrel with the people received their advances kindly enough answering when they were asked if they desired to fire upon their countrymen No they would be damned if they did and showing much honest simplicity and good nature The feeling that the military were No Popery men and were ripe for disobeying orders and joining the mob soon became very prevalent in consequence Rumours of their disaffection and of their leaning towards the popular cause spread from mouth to mouth with astonishing rapidity and whenever they were drawn up idly in the streets or squares there was sure to be a crowd about them cheering and shaking hands and treating them with a great show of confidence and affection By this time the crowd was everywhere all concealment and disguise were laid aside and they pervaded the whole town If any man among them wanted money he had but to knock at the door of a dwelling house or walk into a shop and demand it in the rioters name and his demand was instantly complied with The peaceable citizens being afraid to lay hands upon them singly and alone it may be easily supposed that when gathered together in bodies they were perfectly secure from interruption They assembled in the streets traversed them at their will and pleasure and publicly concerted their plans Business was quite suspended the greater part of the shops were closed most of the houses displayed a blue flag in token of their adherence to the popular side and even the Jews in Houndsditch Whitechapel and those quarters wrote upon their doors or window shutters This House is a True Protestant The crowd was the law and never was the law held in greater dread or more implicitly obeyed It was about six o clock in the evening when a vast mob poured into Lincoln s Inn Fields by every avenue and divided evidently in pursuance of a previous design into several parties It must not be understood that this arrangement was known to the whole crowd but that it was the work of a few leaders who mingling with the men as they came upon the ground and calling to them to fall into this or that parry effected it as rapidly as if it had been determined on by a council of the whole number and every man had known his place It was perfectly notorious to the assemblage that the largest body which comprehended about two thirds of the whole was designed for the attack on Newgate It comprehended all the rioters who had been conspicuous in any of their former proceedings all those whom they recommended as daring hands and fit for the work all those whose companions had been taken in the riots and a great number of people who were relatives or friends of felons in the jail This last class included not only the most desperate and utterly abandoned villains in London but some who were comparatively innocent There was more than one woman there disguised in man s attire and bent upon the rescue of a child or brother There were the two sons of a man who lay under sentence of death and who was to be executed along with three others on the next day but one There was a great parry of boys whose fellow pickpockets were in the prison and at the skirts of all a score of miserable women outcasts from the world seeking to release some other fallen creature as miserable as themselves or moved by a general sympathy perhaps God knows with all who were without hope and wretched Old swords and pistols without ball or powder sledge hammers knives axes saws and weapons pillaged from the butchers shops a forest of iron bars and wooden clubs long ladders for scaling the walls each carried on the shoulders of a dozen men lighted torches tow smeared with pitch and tar and brimstone staves roughly plucked from fence and paling and even crutches taken from crippled beggars in the streets composed their arms When all was ready Hugh and Dennis with Simon Tappertit between them led the way Roaring and chafing like an angry sea the crowd pressed after them Instead of going straight down Holborn to the jail as all expected their leaders took the way to Clerkenwell and pouring down a quiet street halted before a locksmith s house the Golden Key Beat at the door cried Hugh to the men about him We want one of his craft to night Beat it in if no one answers The shop was shut Both door and shutters were of a strong and sturdy kind and they knocked without effect But the impatient crowd raising a cry of Set fire to the house and torches being passed to the front an upper window was thrown open and the stout old locksmith stood before them What now you villains he demanded Where is my daughter Ask no questions of us old man retorted Hugh waving his comrades to be silent but come down and bring the tools of your trade We want you Want me cried the locksmith glancing at the regimental dress he wore Ay and if some that I could name possessed the hearts of mice ye should have had me long ago Mark me my lad and you about him do the same There are a score among ye whom I see now and know who are dead men from this hour Begone and rob an undertaker s while you can You ll want some coffins before long Will you come down cried Hugh Will you give me my daughter ruffian cried the locksmith I know nothing of her Hugh rejoined Burn the door Stop cried the locksmith in a voice that made them falter presenting as he spoke a gun Let an old man do that You can spare him better The young fellow who held the light and who was stooping down before the door rose hastily at these words and fell back The locksmith ran his eye along the upturned faces and kept the weapon levelled at the threshold of his house It had no other rest than his shoulder but was as steady as the house itself Let the man who does it take heed to his prayers he said firmly I warn him Snatching a torch from one who stood near him Hugh was stepping forward with an oath when he was arrested by a shrill and piercing shriek and looking upward saw a fluttering garment on the house top There was another shriek and another and then a shrill voice cried Is Simmun below At the same moment a lean neck was stretched over the parapet and Miss Miggs indistinctly seen in the gathering gloom of evening screeched in a frenzied manner Oh dear gentlemen let me hear Simmuns s answer from his own lips Speak to me Simmun Speak to me Mr Tappertit who was not at all flattered by this compliment looked up and bidding her hold her peace ordered her to come down and open the door for they wanted her master and would take no denial Oh good gentlemen cried Miss Miggs Oh my own precious precious Simmun Hold your nonsense will you retorted Mr Tappertit and come down and open the door G Varden drop that gun or it will be worse for you Don t mind his gun screamed Miggs Simmun and gentlemen I poured a mug of table beer right down the barrel The crowd gave a loud shout which was followed by a roar of laughter It wouldn t go off not if you was to load it up to the muzzle screamed Miggs Simmun and gentlemen I m locked up in the front attic through the little door on the right hand when you think you ve got to the very top of the stairs and up the flight of corner steps being careful not to knock your heads against the rafters and not to tread on one side in case you should fall into the two pair bedroom through the lath and plasture which do not bear but the contrairy Simmun and gentlemen I ve been locked up here for safety but my endeavours has always been and always will be to be on the right side the blessed side and to prenounce the Pope of Babylon and all her inward and her outward workings which is Pagin My sentiments is of little consequences I know cried Miggs with additional shrillness for my positions is but a servant and as sich of humilities still I gives expressions to my feelings and places my reliances on them which entertains my own opinions Without taking much notice of these outpourings of Miss Miggs after she had made her first announcement in relation to the gun the crowd raised a ladder against the window where the locksmith stood and notwithstanding that he closed and fastened and defended it manfully soon forced an entrance by shivering the glass and breaking in the frames After dealing a few stout blows about him he found himself defenceless in the midst of a furious crowd which overflowed the room and softened off in a confused heap of faces at the door and window They were very wrathful with him for he had wounded two men and even called out to those in front to bring him forth and hang him on a lamp post But Gabriel was quite undaunted and looked from Hugh and Dennis who held him by either arm to Simon Tappertit who confronted him You have robbed me of my daughter said the locksmith who is far dearer to me than my life and you may take my life if you will I bless God that I have been enabled to keep my wife free of this scene and that He has made me a man who will not ask mercy at such hands as yours And a wery game old gentleman you are said Mr Dennis approvingly and you express yourself like a man What s the odds brother whether it s a lamp post to night or a feather bed ten year to come eh The locksmith glanced at him disdainfully but returned no other answer For my part said the hangman who particularly favoured the lamp post suggestion I honour your principles They re mine exactly In such sentiments as them and here he emphasised his discourse with an oath I m ready to meet you or any man halfway Have you got a bit of cord anywheres handy Don t put yourself out of the way if you haven t A handkecher will do Don t be a fool master whispered Hugh seizing Varden roughly by the shoulder but do as you re bid You ll soon hear what you re wanted for Do it I ll do nothing at your request or that of any scoundrel here returned the locksmith If you want any service from me you may spare yourselves the pains of telling me what it is I tell you beforehand I ll do nothing for you Mr Dennis was so affected by this constancy on the part of the staunch old man that he protested almost with tears in his eyes that to baulk his inclinations would be an act of cruelty and hard dealing to which he for one never could reconcile his conscience The gentleman he said had avowed in so many words that he was ready for working off such being the case he considered it their duty as a civilised and enlightened crowd to work him off It was not often he observed that they had it in their power to accommodate themselves to the wishes of those from whom they had the misfortune to differ Having now found an individual who expressed a desire which they could reasonably indulge and for himself he was free to confess that in his opinion that desire did honour to his feelings he hoped they would decide to accede to his proposition before going any further It was an experiment which skilfully and dexterously performed would be over in five minutes with great comfort and satisfaction to all parties and though it did not become him Mr Dennis to speak well of himself he trusted he might be allowed to say that he had practical knowledge of the subject and being naturally of an obliging and friendly disposition would work the gentleman off with a deal of pleasure These remarks which were addressed in the midst of a frightful din and turmoil to those immediately about him were received with great favour not so much perhaps because of the hangman s eloquence as on account of the locksmith s obstinacy Gabriel was in imminent peril and he knew it but he preserved a steady silence and would have done so if they had been debating whether they should roast him at a slow fire As the hangman spoke there was some stir and confusion on the ladder and directly he was silent so immediately upon his holding his peace that the crowd below had no time to learn what he had been saying or to shout in response some one at the window cried He has a grey head He is an old man Don t hurt him The locksmith turned with a start towards the place from which the words had come and looked hurriedly at the people who were hanging on the ladder and clinging to each other Pay no respect to my grey hair young man he said answering the voice and not any one he saw I don t ask it My heart is green enough to scorn and despise every man among you band of robbers that you are This incautious speech by no means tended to appease the ferocity of the crowd They cried again to have him brought out and it would have gone hard with the honest locksmith but that Hugh reminded them in answer that they wanted his services and must have them So tell him what we want he said to Simon Tappertit and quickly And open your ears master if you would ever use them after to night Gabriel folded his arms which were now at liberty and eyed his old prentice in silence Lookye Varden said Sim we re bound for Newgate I know you are returned the locksmith You never said a truer word than that To burn it down I mean said Simon and force the gates and set the prisoners at liberty You helped to make the lock of the great door I did said the locksmith You owe me no thanks for that as you ll find before long Maybe returned his journeyman but you must show us how to force it Must I Yes for you know and I don t You must come along with us and pick it with your own hands When I do said the locksmith quietly my hands shall drop off at the wrists and you shall wear them Simon Tappertit on your shoulders for epaulettes We ll see that cried Hugh interposing as the indignation of the crowd again burst forth You fill a basket with the tools he ll want while I bring him downstairs Open the doors below some of you And light the great captain others Is there no business afoot my lads that you can do nothing but stand and grumble They looked at one another and quickly dispersing swarmed over the house plundering and breaking according to their custom and carrying off such articles of value as happened to please their fancy They had no great length of time for these proceedings for the basket of tools was soon prepared and slung over a man s shoulders The preparations being now completed and everything ready for the attack those who were pillaging and destroying in the other rooms were called down to the workshop They were about to issue forth when the man who had been last upstairs stepped forward and asked if the young woman in the garret who was making a terrible noise he said and kept on screaming without the least cessation was to be released For his own part Simon Tappertit would certainly have replied in the negative but the mass of his companions mindful of the good service she had done in the matter of the gun being of a different opinion he had nothing for it but to answer Yes The man accordingly went back again to the rescue and presently returned with Miss Miggs limp and doubled up and very damp from much weeping As the young lady had given no tokens of consciousness on their way downstairs the bearer reported her either dead or dying and being at some loss what to do with her was looking round for a convenient bench or heap of ashes on which to place her senseless form when she suddenly came upon her feet by some mysterious means thrust back her hair stared wildly at Mr Tappertit cried My Simmuns s life is not a wictim and dropped into his arms with such promptitude that he staggered and reeled some paces back beneath his lovely burden Oh bother said Mr Tappertit Here Catch hold of her somebody Lock her up again she never ought to have been let out My Simmun cried Miss Miggs in tears and faintly My for ever ever blessed Simmun Hold up will you said Mr Tappertit in a very unresponsive tone I ll let you fall if you don t What are you sliding your feet off the ground for My angel Simmuns murmured Miggs he promised Promised Well and I ll keep my promise answered Simon testily I mean to provide for you don t I Stand up Where am I to go What is to become of me after my actions of this night cried Miggs What resting places now remains but in the silent tombses I wish you was in the silent tombses I do cried Mr Tappertit and boxed up tight in a good strong one Here he cried to one of the bystanders in whose ear he whispered for a moment Take her off will you You understand where The fellow nodded and taking her in his arms notwithstanding her broken protestations and her struggles which latter species of opposition involving scratches was much more difficult of resistance carried her away They who were in the house poured out into the street the locksmith was taken to the head of the crowd and required to walk between his two conductors the whole body was put in rapid motion and without any shouts or noise they bore down straight on Newgate and halted in a dense mass before the prison gate Chapter 64 Breaking the silence they had hitherto preserved they raised a great cry as soon as they were ranged before the jail and demanded to speak to the governor This visit was not wholly unexpected for his house which fronted the street was strongly barricaded the wicket gate of the prison was closed up and at no loophole or grating was any person to be seen Before they had repeated their summons many times a man appeared upon the roof of the governor s house and asked what it was they wanted Some said one thing some another and some only groaned and hissed It being now nearly dark and the house high many persons in the throng were not aware that any one had come to answer them and continued their clamour until the intelligence was gradually diffused through the whole concourse Ten minutes or more elapsed before any one voice could be heard with tolerable distinctness during which interval the figure remained perched alone against the summer evening sky looking down into the troubled street Are you said Hugh at length Mr Akerman the head jailer here Of course he is brother whispered Dennis But Hugh without minding him took his answer from the man himself Yes he said I am You have got some friends of ours in your custody master I have a good many people in my custody He glanced downward as he spoke into the jail and the feeling that he could see into the different yards and that he overlooked everything which was hidden from their view by the rugged walls so lashed and goaded the mob that they howled like wolves Deliver up our friends said Hugh and you may keep the rest It s my duty to keep them all I shall do my duty If you don t throw the doors open we shall break em down said Hugh for we will have the rioters out All I can do good people Akerman replied is to exhort you to disperse and to remind you that the consequences of any disturbance in this place will be very severe and bitterly repented by most of you when it is too late He made as though he would retire when he said these words but he was checked by the voice of the locksmith Mr Akerman cried Gabriel Mr Akerman I will hear no more from any of you replied the governor turning towards the speaker and waving his hand But I am not one of them said Gabriel I am an honest man Mr Akerman a respectable tradesman Gabriel Varden the locksmith You know me You among the crowd cried the governor in an altered voice Brought here by force brought here to pick the lock of the great door for them rejoined the locksmith Bear witness for me Mr Akerman that I refuse to do it and that I will not do it come what may of my refusal If any violence is done to me please to remember this Is there no way if helping you said the governor None Mr Akerman You ll do your duty and I ll do mine Once again you robbers and cut throats said the locksmith turning round upon them I refuse Ah Howl till you re hoarse I refuse Stay stay said the jailer hastily Mr Varden I know you for a worthy man and one who would do no unlawful act except upon compulsion Upon compulsion sir interposed the locksmith who felt that the tone in which this was said conveyed the speaker s impression that he had ample excuse for yielding to the furious multitude who beset and hemmed him in on every side and among whom he stood an old man quite alone upon compulsion sir I ll do nothing Where is that man said the keeper anxiously who spoke to me just now Here Hugh replied Do you know what the guilt of murder is and that by keeping that honest tradesman at your side you endanger his life We know it very well he answered for what else did we bring him here Let s have our friends master and you shall have your friend Is that fair lads The mob replied to him with a loud Hurrah You see how it is sir cried Varden Keep em out in King George s name Remember what I have said Good night There was no more parley A shower of stones and other missiles compelled the keeper of the jail to retire and the mob pressing on and swarming round the walls forced Gabriel Varden close up to the door In vain the basket of tools was laid upon the ground before him and he was urged in turn by promises by blows by offers of reward and threats of instant death to do the office for which they had brought him there No cried the sturdy locksmith I will not He had never loved his life so well as then but nothing could move him The savage faces that glared upon him look where he would the cries of those who thirsted like wild animals for his blood the sight of men pressing forward and trampling down their fellows as they strove to reach him and struck at him above the heads of other men with axes and with iron bars all failed to daunt him He looked from man to man and face to face and still with quickened breath and lessening colour cried firmly I will not Dennis dealt him a blow upon the face which felled him to the ground He sprung up again like a man in the prime of life and with blood upon his forehead caught him by the throat You cowardly dog he said Give me my daughter Give me my daughter They struggled together Some cried Kill him and some but they were not near enough strove to trample him to death Tug as he would at the old man s wrists the hangman could not force him to unclench his hands Is this all the return you make me you ungrateful monster he articulated with great difficulty and with many oaths Give me my daughter cried the locksmith who was now as fierce as those who gathered round him Give me my daughter He was down again and up and down once more and buffeting with a score of them who bandied him from hand to hand when one tall fellow fresh from a slaughter house whose dress and great thigh boots smoked hot with grease and blood raised a pole axe and swearing a horrible oath aimed it at the old man s uncovered head At that instant and in the very act he fell himself as if struck by lightning and over his body a one armed man came darting to the locksmith s side Another man was with him and both caught the locksmith roughly in their grasp Leave him to us they cried to Hugh struggling as they spoke to force a passage backward through the crowd Leave him to us Why do you waste your whole strength on such as he when a couple of men can finish him in as many minutes You lose time Remember the prisoners remember Barnaby The cry ran through the mob Hammers began to rattle on the walls and every man strove to reach the prison and be among the foremost rank Fighting their way through the press and struggle as desperately as if they were in the midst of enemies rather than their own friends the two men retreated with the locksmith between them and dragged him through the very heart of the concourse And now the strokes began to fall like hail upon the gate and on the strong building for those who could not reach the door spent their fierce rage on anything even on the great blocks of stone which shivered their weapons into fragments and made their hands and arms to tingle as if the walls were active in their stout resistance and dealt them back their blows The clash of iron ringing upon iron mingled with the deafening tumult and sounded high above it as the great sledge hammers rattled on the nailed and plated door the sparks flew off in showers men worked in gangs and at short intervals relieved each other that all their strength might be devoted to the work but there stood the portal still as grim and dark and strong as ever and saving for the dints upon its battered surface quite unchanged While some brought all their energies to bear upon this toilsome task and some rearing ladders against the prison tried to clamber to the summit of the walls they were too short to scale and some again engaged a body of police a hundred strong and beat them back and trod them under foot by force of numbers others besieged the house on which the jailer had appeared and driving in the door brought out his furniture and piled it up against the prison gate to make a bonfire which should burn it down As soon as this device was understood all those who had laboured hitherto cast down their tools and helped to swell the heap which reached half way across the street and was so high that those who threw more fuel on the top got up by ladders When all the keeper s goods were flung upon this costly pile to the last fragment they smeared it with the pitch and tar and rosin they had brought and sprinkled it with turpentine To all the woodwork round the prison doors they did the like leaving not a joist or beam untouched This infernal christening performed they fired the pile with lighted matches and with blazing tow and then stood by awaiting the result The furniture being very dry and rendered more combustible by wax and oil besides the arts they had used took fire at once The flames roared high and fiercely blackening the prison wall and twining up its loftly front like burning serpents At first they crowded round the blaze and vented their exultation only in their looks but when it grew hotter and fiercer when it crackled leaped and roared like a great furnace when it shone upon the opposite houses and lighted up not only the pale and wondering faces at the windows but the inmost corners of each habitation when through the deep red heat and glow the fire was seen sporting and toying with the door now clinging to its obdurate surface now gliding off with fierce inconstancy and soaring high into the sky anon returning to fold it in its burning grasp and lure it to its ruin when it shone and gleamed so brightly that the church clock of St Sepulchre s so often pointing to the hour of death was legible as in broad day and the vane upon its steeple top glittered in the unwonted light like something richly jewelled when blackened stone and sombre brick grew ruddy in the deep reflection and windows shone like burnished gold dotting the longest distance in the fiery vista with their specks of brightness when wall and tower and roof and chimney stack seemed drunk and in the flickering glare appeared to reel and stagger when scores of objects never seen before burst out upon the view and things the most familiar put on some new aspect then the mob began to join the whirl and with loud yells and shouts and clamour such as happily is seldom heard bestirred themselves to feed the fire and keep it at its height Although the heat was so intense that the paint on the houses over against the prison parched and crackled up and swelling into boils as it were from excess of torture broke and crumbled away although the glass fell from the window sashes and the lead and iron on the roofs blistered the incautious hand that touched them and the sparrows in the eaves took wing and rendered giddy by the smoke fell fluttering down upon the blazing pile still the fire was tended unceasingly by busy hands and round it men were going always They never slackened in their zeal or kept aloof but pressed upon the flames so hard that those in front had much ado to save themselves from being thrust in if one man swooned or dropped a dozen struggled for his place and that although they knew the pain and thirst and pressure to be unendurable Those who fell down in fainting fits and were not crushed or burnt were carried to an inn yard close at hand and dashed with water from a pump of which buckets full were passed from man to man among the crowd but such was the strong desire of all to drink and such the fighting to be first that for the most part the whole contents were spilled upon the ground without the lips of one man being moistened Meanwhile and in the midst of all the roar and outcry those who were nearest to the pile heaped up again the burning fragments that came toppling down and raked the fire about the door which although a sheet of flame was still a door fast locked and barred and kept them out Great pieces of blazing wood were passed besides above the people s heads to such as stood about the ladders and some of these climbing up to the topmost stave and holding on with one hand by the prison wall exerted all their skill and force to cast these fire brands on the roof or down into the yards within In many instances their efforts were successful which occasioned a new and appalling addition to the horrors of the scene for the prisoners within seeing from between their bars that the fire caught in many places and thrived fiercely and being all locked up in strong cells for the night began to know that they were in danger of being burnt alive This terrible fear spreading from cell to cell and from yard to yard vented itself in such dismal cries and wailings and in such dreadful shrieks for help that the whole jail resounded with the noise which was loudly heard even above the shouting of the mob and roaring of the flames and was so full of agony and despair that it made the boldest tremble It was remarkable that these cries began in that quarter of the jail which fronted Newgate Street where it was well known the men who were to suffer death on Thursday were confined And not only were these four who had so short a time to live the first to whom the dread of being burnt occurred but they were throughout the most importunate of all for they could be plainly heard notwithstanding the great thickness of the walls crying that the wind set that way and that the flames would shortly reach them and calling to the officers of the jail to come and quench the fire from a cistern which was in their yard and full of water Judging from what the crowd outside the walls could hear from time to time these four doomed wretches never ceased to call for help and that with as much distraction and in as great a frenzy of attachment to existence as though each had an honoured happy life before him instead of eight and forty hours of miserable imprisonment and then a violent and shameful death But the anguish and suffering of the two sons of one of these men when they heard or fancied that they heard their father s voice is past description After wringing their hands and rushing to and fro as if they were stark mad one mounted on the shoulders of his brother and tried to clamber up the face of the high wall guarded at the top with spikes and points of iron And when he fell among the crowd he was not deterred by his bruises but mounted up again and fell again and when he found the feat impossible began to beat the stones and tear them with his hands as if he could that way make a breach in the strong building and force a passage in At last they cleft their way among the mob about the door though many men a dozen times their match had tried in vain to do so and were seen in yes in the fire striving to prize it down with crowbars Nor were they alone affected by the outcry from within the prison The women who were looking on shrieked loudly beat their hands together stopped their ears and many fainted the men who were not near the walls and active in the siege rather than do nothing tore up the pavement of the street and did so with a haste and fury they could not have surpassed if that had been the jail and they were near their object Not one living creature in the throng was for an instant still The whole great mass were mad A shout Another Another yet though few knew why or what it meant But those around the gate had seen it slowly yield and drop from its topmost hinge It hung on that side by but one but it was upright still because of the bar and its having sunk of its own weight into the heap of ashes at its foot There was now a gap at the top of the doorway through which could be descried a gloomy passage cavernous and dark Pile up the fire It burnt fiercely The door was red hot and the gap wider They vainly tried to shield their faces with their hands and standing as if in readiness for a spring watched the place Dark figures some crawling on their hands and knees some carried in the arms of others were seen to pass along the roof It was plain the jail could hold out no longer The keeper and his officers and their wives and children were escaping Pile up the fire The door sank down again it settled deeper in the cinders tottered yielded was down As they shouted again they fell back for a moment and left a clear space about the fire that lay between them and the jail entry Hugh leapt upon the blazing heap and scattering a train of sparks into the air and making the dark lobby glitter with those that hung upon his dress dashed into the jail The hangman followed And then so many rushed upon their track that the fire got trodden down and thinly strewn about the street but there was no need of it now for inside and out the prison was in flames Chapter 65 During the whole course of the terrible scene which was now at its height one man in the jail suffered a degree of fear and mental torment which had no parallel in the endurance even of those who lay under sentence of death When the rioters first assembled before the building the murderer was roused from sleep if such slumbers as his may have that blessed name by the roar of voices and the struggling of a great crowd He started up as these sounds met his ear and sitting on his bedstead listened After a short interval of silence the noise burst out again Still listening attentively he made out in course of time that the jail was besieged by a furious multitude His guilty conscience instantly arrayed these men against himself and brought the fear upon him that he would be singled out and torn to pieces Once impressed with the terror of this conceit everything tended to confirm and strengthen it His double crime the circumstances under which it had been committed the length of time that had elapsed and its discovery in spite of all made him as it were the visible object of the Almighty s wrath In all the crime and vice and moral gloom of the great pest house of the capital he stood alone marked and singled out by his great guilt a Lucifer among the devils The other prisoners were a host hiding and sheltering each other a crowd like that without the walls He was one man against the whole united concourse a single solitary lonely man from whom the very captives in the jail fell off and shrunk appalled It might be that the intelligence of his capture having been bruited abroad they had come there purposely to drag him out and kill him in the street or it might be that they were the rioters and in pursuance of an old design had come to sack the prison But in either case he had no belief or hope that they would spare him Every shout they raised and every sound they made was a blow upon his heart As the attack went on he grew more wild and frantic in his terror tried to pull away the bars that guarded the chimney and prevented him from climbing up called loudly on the turnkeys to cluster round the cell and save him from the fury of the rabble or put him in some dungeon underground no matter of what depth how dark it was or loathsome or beset with rats and creeping things so that it hid him and was hard to find But no one came or answered him Fearful even while he cried to them of attracting attention he was silent By and bye he saw as he looked from his grated window a strange glimmering on the stone walls and pavement of the yard It was feeble at first and came and went as though some officers with torches were passing to and fro upon the roof of the prison Soon it reddened and lighted brands came whirling down spattering the ground with fire and burning sullenly in corners One rolled beneath a wooden bench and set it in a blaze another caught a water spout and so went climbing up the wall leaving a long straight track of fire behind it After a time a slow thick shower of burning fragments from some upper portion of the prison which was blazing nigh began to fall before his door Remembering that it opened outwards he knew that every spark which fell upon the heap and in the act lost its bright life and died an ugly speck of dust and rubbish helped to entomb him in a living grave Still though the jail resounded with shrieks and cries for help though the fire bounded up as if each separate flame had had a tiger s life and roared as though in every one there were a hungry voice though the heat began to grow intense and the air suffocating and the clamour without increased and the danger of his situation even from one merciless element was every moment more extreme still he was afraid to raise his voice again lest the crowd should break in and should of their own ears or from the information given them by the other prisoners get the clue to his place of confinement Thus fearful alike of those within the prison and of those without of noise and silence light and darkness of being released and being left there to die he was so tortured and tormented that nothing man has ever done to man in the horrible caprice of power and cruelty exceeds his self inflicted punishment Now now the door was down Now they came rushing through the jail calling to each other in the vaulted passages clashing the iron gates dividing yard from yard beating at the doors of cells and wards wrenching off bolts and locks and bars tearing down the door posts to get men out endeavouring to drag them by main force through gaps and windows where a child could scarcely pass whooping and yelling without a moment s rest and running through the heat and flames as if they were cased in metal By their legs their arms the hair upon their heads they dragged the prisoners out Some threw themselves upon the captives as they got towards the door and tried to file away their irons some danced about them with a frenzied joy and rent their clothes and were ready as it seemed to tear them limb from limb Now a party of a dozen men came darting through the yard into which the murderer cast fearful glances from his darkened window dragging a prisoner along the ground whose dress they had nearly torn from his body in their mad eagerness to set him free and who was bleeding and senseless in their hands Now a score of prisoners ran to and fro who had lost themselves in the intricacies of the prison and were so bewildered with the noise and glare that they knew not where to turn or what to do and still cried out for help as loudly as before Anon some famished wretch whose theft had been a loaf of bread or scrap of butcher s meat came skulking past barefooted going slowly away because that jail his house was burning not because he had any other or had friends to meet or old haunts to revisit or any liberty to gain but liberty to starve and die And then a knot of highwaymen went trooping by conducted by the friends they had among the crowd who muffled their fetters as they went along with handkerchiefs and bands of hay and wrapped them in coats and cloaks and gave them drink from bottles and held it to their lips because of their handcuffs which there was no time to remove All this and Heaven knows how much more was done amidst a noise a hurry and distraction like nothing that we know of even in our dreams which seemed for ever on the rise and never to decrease for the space of a single instant He was still looking down from his window upon these things when a band of men with torches ladders axes and many kinds of weapons poured into the yard and hammering at his door inquired if there were any prisoner within He left the window when he saw them coming and drew back into the remotest corner of the cell but although he returned them no answer they had a fancy that some one was inside for they presently set ladders against it and began to tear away the bars at the casement not only that indeed but with pickaxes to hew down the very stones in the wall As soon as they had made a breach at the window large enough for the admission of a man s head one of them thrust in a torch and looked all round the room He followed this man s gaze until it rested on himself and heard him demand why he had not answered but made him no reply In the general surprise and wonder they were used to this without saying anything more they enlarged the breach until it was large enough to admit the body of a man and then came dropping down upon the floor one after another until the cell was full They caught him up among them handed him to the window and those who stood upon the ladders passed him down upon the pavement of the yard Then the rest came out one after another and bidding him fly and lose no time or the way would be choked up hurried away to rescue others It seemed not a minute s work from first to last He staggered to his feet incredulous of what had happened when the yard was filled again and a crowd rushed on hurrying Barnaby among them In another minute not so much another minute the same instant with no lapse or interval between he and his son were being passed from hand to hand through the dense crowd in the street and were glancing backward at a burning pile which some one said was Newgate From the moment of their first entrance into the prison the crowd dispersed themselves about it and swarmed into every chink and crevice as if they had a perfect acquaintance with its innermost parts and bore in their minds an exact plan of the whole For this immediate knowledge of the place they were no doubt in a great degree indebted to the hangman who stood in the lobby directing some to go this way some that and some the other and who materially assisted in bringing about the wonderful rapidity with which the release of the prisoners was effected But this functionary of the law reserved one important piece of intelligence and kept it snugly to himself When he had issued his instructions relative to every other part of the building and the mob were dispersed from end to end and busy at their work he took a bundle of keys from a kind of cupboard in the wall and going by a kind of passage near the chapel it joined the governors house and was then on fire betook himself to the condemned cells which were a series of small strong dismal rooms opening on a low gallery guarded at the end at which he entered by a strong iron wicket and at its opposite extremity by two doors and a thick grate Having double locked the wicket and assured himself that the other entrances were well secured he sat down on a bench in the gallery and sucked the head of his stick with the utmost complacency tranquillity and contentment It would have been strange enough a man s enjoying himself in this quiet manner while the prison was burning and such a tumult was cleaving the air though he had been outside the walls But here in the very heart of the building and moreover with the prayers and cries of the four men under sentence sounding in his ears and their hands stretched our through the gratings in their cell doors clasped in frantic entreaty before his very eyes it was particularly remarkable Indeed Mr Dennis appeared to think it an uncommon circumstance and to banter himself upon it for he thrust his hat on one side as some men do when they are in a waggish humour sucked the head of his stick with a higher relish and smiled as though he would say Dennis you re a rum dog you re a queer fellow you re capital company Dennis and quite a character He sat in this way for some minutes while the four men in the cells who were certain that somebody had entered the gallery but could not see who gave vent to such piteous entreaties as wretches in their miserable condition may be supposed to have been inspired with urging whoever it was to set them at liberty for the love of Heaven and protesting with great fervour and truly enough perhaps for the time that if they escaped they would amend their ways and would never never never again do wrong before God or man but would lead penitent and sober lives and sorrowfully repent the crimes they had committed The terrible energy with which they spoke would have moved any person no matter how good or just if any good or just person could have strayed into that sad place that night to have set them at liberty and while he would have left any other punishment to its free course to have saved them from this last dreadful and repulsive penalty which never turned a man inclined to evil and has hardened thousands who were half inclined to good Mr Dennis who had been bred and nurtured in the good old school and had administered the good old laws on the good old plan always once and sometimes twice every six weeks for a long time bore these appeals with a deal of philosophy Being at last however rather disturbed in his pleasant reflection by their repetition he rapped at one of the doors with his stick and cried Hold your noise there will you At this they all cried together that they were to be hanged on the next day but one and again implored his aid Aid For what said Mr Dennis playfully rapping the knuckles of the hand nearest him To save us they cried Oh certainly said Mr Dennis winking at the wall in the absence of any friend with whom he could humour the joke And so you re to be worked off are you brothers Unless we are released to night one of them cried we are dead men I tell you what it is said the hangman gravely I m afraid my friend that you re not in that ere state of mind that s suitable to your condition then you re not a going to be released don t think it Will you leave off that ere indecent row I wonder you an t ashamed of yourselves I do He followed up this reproof by rapping every set of knuckles one after the other and having done so resumed his seat again with a cheerful countenance You ve had law he said crossing his legs and elevating his eyebrows laws have been made a purpose for you a wery handsome prison s been made a purpose for you a parson s kept a purpose for you a constitootional officer s appointed a purpose for you carts is maintained a purpose for you and yet you re not contented WILL you hold that noise you sir in the furthest A groan was the only answer So well as I can make out said Mr Dennis in a tone of mingled badinage and remonstrance there s not a man among you I begin to think I m on the opposite side and among the ladies though for the matter of that I ve seen a many ladies face it out in a manner that did honour to the sex You in number two don t grind them teeth of yours Worse manners said the hangman rapping at the door with his stick I never see in this place afore I m ashamed of you You re a disgrace to the Bailey After pausing for a moment to hear if anything could be pleaded in justification Mr Dennis resumed in a sort of coaxing tone Now look ee here you four I m come here to take care of you and see that you an t burnt instead of the other thing It s no use your making any noise for you won t be found out by them as has broken in and you ll only be hoarse when you come to the speeches which is a pity What I say in respect to the speeches always is Give it mouth That s my maxim Give it mouth I ve heerd said the hangman pulling off his hat to take his handkerchief from the crown and wipe his face and then putting it on again a little more on one side than before I ve heerd a eloquence on them boards you know what boards I mean and have heerd a degree of mouth given to them speeches that they was as clear as a bell and as good as a play There s a pattern And always when a thing of this natur s to come off what I stand up for is a proper frame of mind Let s have a proper frame of mind and we can go through with it creditable pleasant sociable Whatever you do and I address myself in particular to you in the furthest never snivel I d sooner by half though I lose by it see a man tear his clothes a purpose to spile em before they come to me than find him snivelling It s ten to one a better frame of mind every way While the hangman addressed them to this effect in the tone and with the air of a pastor in familiar conversation with his flock the noise had been in some degree subdued for the rioters were busy in conveying the prisoners to the Sessions House which was beyond the main walls of the prison though connected with it and the crowd were busy too in passing them from thence along the street But when he had got thus far in his discourse the sound of voices in the yard showed plainly that the mob had returned and were coming that way and directly afterwards a violent crashing at the grate below gave note of their attack upon the cells as they were called at last It was in vain the hangman ran from door to door and covered the grates one after another with his hat in futile efforts to stifle the cries of the four men within it was in vain he dogged their outstretched hands and beat them with his stick or menaced them with new and lingering pains in the execution of his office the place resounded with their cries These together with the feeling that they were now the last men in the jail so worked upon and stimulated the besiegers that in an incredibly short space of time they forced the strong grate down below which was formed of iron rods two inches square drove in the two other doors as if they had been but deal partitions and stood at the end of the gallery with only a bar or two between them and the cells Halloa cried Hugh who was the first to look into the dusky passage Dennis before us Well done old boy Be quick and open here for we shall be suffocated in the smoke going out Go out at once then said Dennis What do you want here Want echoed Hugh The four men Four devils cried the hangman Don t you know they re left for death on Thursday Don t you respect the law the constitootion nothing Let the four men be Is this a time for joking cried Hugh Do you hear em Pull away these bars that have got fixed between the door and the ground and let us in Brother said the hangman in a low voice as he stooped under pretence of doing what Hugh desired but only looked up in his face can t you leave these here four men to me if I ve the whim You do what you like and have what you like of everything for your share give me my share I want these four men left alone I tell you Pull the bars down or stand out of the way was Hugh s reply You can turn the crowd if you like you know that well enough brother said the hangman slowly What You WILL come in will you Yes You won t let these men alone and leave em to me You ve no respect for nothing haven t you said the hangman retreating to the door by which he had entered and regarding his companion with a scowl You WILL come in will you brother I tell you yes What the devil ails you Where are you going No matter where I m going rejoined the hangman looking in again at the iron wicket which he had nearly shut upon himself and held ajar Remember where you re coming That s all With that he shook his likeness at Hugh and giving him a grin compared with which his usual smile was amiable disappeared and shut the door Hugh paused no longer but goaded alike by the cries of the convicts and by the impatience of the crowd warned the man immediately behind him the way was only wide enough for one abreast to stand back and wielded a sledge hammer with such strength that after a few blows the iron bent and broke and gave them free admittance It the two sons of one of these men of whom mention has been made were furious in their zeal before they had now the wrath and vigour of lions Calling to the man within each cell to keep as far back as he could lest the axes crashing through the door should wound him a party went to work upon each one to beat it in by sheer strength and force the bolts and staples from their hold But although these two lads had the weakest party and the worst armed and did not begin until after the others having stopped to whisper to him through the grate that door was the first open and that man was the first out As they dragged him into the gallery to knock off his irons he fell down among them a mere heap of chains and was carried out in that state on men s shoulders with no sign of life The release of these four wretched creatures and conveying them astounded and bewildered into the streets so full of life a spectacle they had never thought to see again until they emerged from solitude and silence upon that last journey when the air should be heavy with the pent up breath of thousands and the streets and houses should be built and roofed with human faces not with bricks and tiles and stones was the crowning horror of the scene Their pale and haggard looks and hollow eyes their staggering feet and hands stretched out as if to save themselves from falling their wandering and uncertain air the way they heaved and gasped for breath as though in water when they were first plunged into the crowd all marked them for the men No need to say this one was doomed to die for there were the words broadly stamped and branded on his face The crowd fell off as if they had been laid out for burial and had risen in their shrouds and many were seen to shudder as though they had been actually dead men when they chanced to touch or brush against their garments At the bidding of the mob the houses were all illuminated that night lighted up from top to bottom as at a time of public gaiety and joy Many years afterwards old people who lived in their youth near this part of the city remembered being in a great glare of light within doors and without and as they looked timid and frightened children from the windows seeing a FACE go by Though the whole great crowd and all its other terrors had faded from their recollection this one object remained alone distinct and well remembered Even in the unpractised minds of infants one of these doomed men darting past and but an instant seen was an image of force enough to dim the whole concourse to find itself an all absorbing place and hold it ever after When this last task had been achieved the shouts and cries grew fainter the clank of fetters which had resounded on all sides as the prisoners escaped was heard no more all the noises of the crowd subsided into a hoarse and sullen murmur as it passed into the distance and when the human tide had rolled away a melancholy heap of smoking ruins marked the spot where it had lately chafed and roared Chapter 66 Although he had had no rest upon the previous night and had watched with little intermission for some weeks past sleeping only in the day by starts and snatches Mr Haredale from the dawn of morning until sunset sought his niece in every place where he deemed it possible she could have taken refuge All day long nothing save a draught of water passed his lips though he prosecuted his inquiries far and wide and never so much as sat down once In every quarter he could think of at Chigwell and in London at the houses of the tradespeople with whom he dealt and of the friends he knew he pursued his search A prey to the most harrowing anxieties and apprehensions he went from magistrate to magistrate and finally to the Secretary of State The only comfort he received was from this minister who assured him that the Government being now driven to the exercise of the extreme prerogatives of the Crown were determined to exert them that a proclamation would probably be out upon the morrow giving to the military discretionary and unlimited power in the suppression of the riots that the sympathies of the King the Administration and both Houses of Parliament and indeed of all good men of every religious persuasion were strongly with the injured Catholics and that justice should be done them at any cost or hazard He told him moreover that other persons whose houses had been burnt had for a time lost sight of their children or their relatives but had in every case within his knowledge succeeded in discovering them that his complaint should be remembered and fully stated in the instructions given to the officers in command and to all the inferior myrmidons of justice and that everything that could be done to help him should be done with a goodwill and in good faith Grateful for this consolation feeble as it was in its reference to the past and little hope as it afforded him in connection with the subject of distress which lay nearest to his heart and really thankful for the interest the minister expressed and seemed to feel in his condition Mr Haredale withdrew He found himself with the night coming on alone in the streets and destitute of any place in which to lay his head He entered an hotel near Charing Cross and ordered some refreshment and a bed He saw that his faint and worn appearance attracted the attention of the landlord and his waiters and thinking that they might suppose him to be penniless took out his purse and laid it on the table It was not that the landlord said in a faltering voice If he were one of those who had suffered by the rioters he durst not give him entertainment He had a family of children and had been twice warned to be careful in receiving guests He heartily prayed his forgiveness but what could he do Nothing No man felt that more sincerely than Mr Haredale He told the man as much and left the house Feeling that he might have anticipated this occurrence after what he had seen at Chigwell in the morning where no man dared to touch a spade though he offered a large reward to all who would come and dig among the ruins of his house he walked along the Strand too proud to expose himself to another refusal and of too generous a spirit to involve in distress or ruin any honest tradesman who might be weak enough to give him shelter He wandered into one of the streets by the side of the river and was pacing in a thoughtful manner up and down thinking of things that had happened long ago when he heard a servant man at an upper window call to another on the opposite side of the street that the mob were setting fire to Newgate To Newgate where that man was His failing strength returned his energies came back with tenfold vigour on the instant If it were possible if they should set the murderer free was he after all he had undergone to die with the suspicion of having slain his own brother dimly gathering about him He had no consciousness of going to the jail but there he stood before it There was the crowd wedged and pressed together in a dense dark moving mass and there were the flames soaring up into the air His head turned round and round lights flashed before his eyes and he struggled hard with two men Nay nay said one Be more yourself my good sir We attract attention here Come away What can you do among so many men The gentleman s always for doing something said the other forcing him along as he spoke I like him for that I do like him for that They had by this time got him into a court hard by the prison He looked from one to the other and as he tried to release himself felt that he tottered on his feet He who had spoken first was the old gentleman whom he had seen at the Lord Mayor s The other was John Grueby who had stood by him so manfully at Westminster What does this mean he asked them faintly How came we together On the skirts of the crowd returned the distiller but come with us Pray come with us You seem to know my friend here Surely said Mr Haredale looking in a kind of stupor at John He ll tell you then returned the old gentleman that I am a man to be trusted He s my servant He was lately as you know I have no doubt in Lord George Gordon s service but he left it and brought in pure goodwill to me and others who are marked by the rioters such intelligence as he had picked up of their designs On one condition please sir said John touching his hat No evidence against my lord a misled man a kind hearted man sir My lord never intended this The condition will be observed of course rejoined the old distiller It s a point of honour But come with us sir pray come with us John Grueby added no entreaties but he adopted a different kind of persuasion by putting his arm through one of Mr Haredale s while his master took the other and leading him away with all speed Sensible from a strange lightness in his head and a difficulty in fixing his thoughts on anything even to the extent of bearing his companions in his mind for a minute together without looking at them that his brain was affected by the agitation and suffering through which he had passed and to which he was still a prey Mr Haredale let them lead him where they would As they went along he was conscious of having no command over what he said or thought and that he had a fear of going mad The distiller lived as he had told him when they first met on Holborn Hill where he had great storehouses and drove a large trade They approached his house by a back entrance lest they should attract the notice of the crowd and went into an upper room which faced towards the street the windows however in common with those of every other room in the house were boarded up inside in order that out of doors all might appear quite dark They laid him on a sofa in this chamber perfectly insensible but John immediately fetching a surgeon who took from him a large quantity of blood he gradually came to himself As he was for the time too weak to walk they had no difficulty in persuading him to remain there all night and got him to bed without loss of a minute That done they gave him cordial and some toast and presently a pretty strong composing draught under the influence of which he soon fell into a lethargy and for a time forgot his troubles The vintner who was a very hearty old fellow and a worthy man had no thoughts of going to bed himself for he had received several threatening warnings from the rioters and had indeed gone out that evening to try and gather from the conversation of the mob whether his house was to be the next attacked He sat all night in an easy chair in the same room dozing a little now and then and received from time to time the reports of John Grueby and two or three other trustworthy persons in his employ who went out into the streets as scouts and for whose entertainment an ample allowance of good cheer which the old vintner despite his anxiety now and then attacked himself was set forth in an adjoining chamber These accounts were of a sufficiently alarming nature from the first but as the night wore on they grew so much worse and involved such a fearful amount of riot and destruction that in comparison with these new tidings all the previous disturbances sunk to nothing The first intelligence that came was of the taking of Newgate and the escape of all the prisoners whose track as they made up Holborn and into the adjacent streets was proclaimed to those citizens who were shut up in their houses by the rattling of their chains which formed a dismal concert and was heard in every direction as though so many forges were at work The flames too shone so brightly through the vintner s skylights that the rooms and staircases below were nearly as light as in broad day while the distant shouting of the mob seemed to shake the very walls and ceilings At length they were heard approaching the house and some minutes of terrible anxiety ensued They came close up and stopped before it but after giving three loud yells went on And although they returned several times that night creating new alarms each time they did nothing there having their hands full Shortly after they had gone away for the first time one of the scouts came running in with the news that they had stopped before Lord Mansfield s house in Bloomsbury Square Soon afterwards there came another and another and then the first returned again and so by little and little their tale was this That the mob gathering round Lord Mansfield s house had called on those within to open the door and receiving no reply for Lord and Lady Mansfield were at that moment escaping by the backway forced an entrance according to their usual custom That they then began to demolish the house with great fury and setting fire to it in several parts involved in a common ruin the whole of the costly furniture the plate and jewels a beautiful gallery of pictures the rarest collection of manuscripts ever possessed by any one private person in the world and worse than all because nothing could replace this loss the great Law Library on almost every page of which were notes in the Judge s own hand of inestimable value being the results of the study and experience of his whole life That while they were howling and exulting round the fire a troop of soldiers with a magistrate among them came up and being too late for the mischief was by that time done began to disperse the crowd That the Riot Act being read and the crowd still resisting the soldiers received orders to fire and levelling their muskets shot dead at the first discharge six men and a woman and wounded many persons and loading again directly fired another volley but over the people s heads it was supposed as none were seen to fall That thereupon and daunted by the shrieks and tumult the crowd began to disperse and the soldiers went away leaving the killed and wounded on the ground which they had no sooner done than the rioters came back again and taking up the dead bodies and the wounded people formed into a rude procession having the bodies in the front That in this order they paraded off with a horrible merriment fixing weapons in the dead men s hands to make them look as if alive and preceded by a fellow ringing Lord Mansfield s dinner bell with all his might The scouts reported further that this party meeting with some others who had been at similar work elsewhere they all united into one and drafting off a few men with the killed and wounded marched away to Lord Mansfield s country seat at Caen Wood between Hampstead and Highgate bent upon destroying that house likewise and lighting up a great fire there which from that height should be seen all over London But in this they were disappointed for a party of horse having arrived before them they retreated faster than they went and came straight back to town There being now a great many parties in the streets each went to work according to its humour and a dozen houses were quickly blazing including those of Sir John Fielding and two other justices and four in Holborn one of the greatest thoroughfares in London which were all burning at the same time and burned until they went out of themselves for the people cut the engine hose and would not suffer the firemen to play upon the flames At one house near Moorfields they found in one of the rooms some canary birds in cages and these they cast into the fire alive The poor little creatures screamed it was said like infants when they were flung upon the blaze and one man was so touched that he tried in vain to save them which roused the indignation of the crowd and nearly cost him his life At this same house one of the fellows who went through the rooms breaking the furniture and helping to destroy the building found a child s doll a poor toy which he exhibited at the window to the mob below as the image of some unholy saint which the late occupants had worshipped While he was doing this another man with an equally tender conscience they had both been foremost in throwing down the canary birds for roasting alive took his seat on the parapet of the house and harangued the crowd from a pamphlet circulated by the Association relative to the true principles of Christianity Meanwhile the Lord Mayor with his hands in his pockets looked on as an idle man might look at any other show and seemed mightily satisfied to have got a good place Such were the accounts brought to the old vintner by his servants as he sat at the side of Mr Haredale s bed having been unable even to doze after the first part of the night too much disturbed by his own fears by the cries of the mob the light of the fires and the firing of the soldiers Such with the addition of the release of all the prisoners in the New Jail at Clerkenwell and as many robberies of passengers in the streets as the crowd had leisure to indulge in were the scenes of which Mr Haredale was happily unconscious and which were all enacted before midnight Chapter 67 When darkness broke away and morning began to dawn the town wore a strange aspect indeed Sleep had hardly been thought of all night The general alarm was so apparent in the faces of the inhabitants and its expression was so aggravated by want of rest few persons with any property to lose having dared go to bed since Monday that a stranger coming into the streets would have supposed some mortal pest or plague to have been raging In place of the usual cheerfulness and animation of morning everything was dead and silent The shops remained closed offices and warehouses were shut the coach and chair stands were deserted no carts or waggons rumbled through the slowly waking streets the early cries were all hushed a universal gloom prevailed Great numbers of people were out even at daybreak but they flitted to and fro as though they shrank from the sound of their own footsteps the public ways were haunted rather than frequented and round the smoking ruins people stood apart from one another and in silence not venturing to condemn the rioters or to be supposed to do so even in whispers At the Lord President s in Piccadilly at Lambeth Palace at the Lord Chancellor s in Great Ormond Street in the Royal Exchange the Bank the Guildhall the Inns of Court the Courts of Law and every chamber fronting the streets near Westminster Hall and the Houses of Parliament parties of soldiers were posted before daylight A body of Horse Guards paraded Palace Yard an encampment was formed in the Park where fifteen hundred men and five battalions of Militia were under arms the Tower was fortified the drawbridges were raised the cannon loaded and pointed and two regiments of artillery busied in strengthening the fortress and preparing it for defence A numerous detachment of soldiers were stationed to keep guard at the New River Head which the people had threatened to attack and where it was said they meant to cut off the main pipes so that there might be no water for the extinction of the flames In the Poultry and on Cornhill and at several other leading points iron chains were drawn across the street parties of soldiers were distributed in some of the old city churches while it was yet dark and in several private houses among them Lord Rockingham s in Grosvenor Square which were blockaded as though to sustain a siege and had guns pointed from the windows When the sun rose it shone into handsome apartments filled with armed men the furniture hastily heaped away in corners and made of little or no account in the terror of the time on arms glittering in city chambers among desks and stools and dusty books into little smoky churchyards in odd lanes and by ways with soldiers lying down among the tombs or lounging under the shade of the one old tree and their pile of muskets sparkling in the light on solitary sentries pacing up and down in courtyards silent now but yesterday resounding with the din and hum of business everywhere on guard rooms garrisons and threatening preparations As the day crept on still more unusual sights were witnessed in the streets The gates of the King s Bench and Fleet Prisons being opened at the usual hour were found to have notices affixed to them announcing that the rioters would come that night to burn them down The wardens too well knowing the likelihood there was of this promise being fulfilled were fain to set their prisoners at liberty and give them leave to move their goods so all day such of them as had any furniture were occupied in conveying it some to this place some to that and not a few to the brokers shops where they gladly sold it for any wretched price those gentry chose to give There were some broken men among these debtors who had been in jail so long and were so miserable and destitute of friends so dead to the world and utterly forgotten and uncared for that they implored their jailers not to set them free and to send them if need were to some other place of custody But they refusing to comply lest they should incur the anger of the mob turned them into the streets where they wandered up and down hardly remembering the ways untrodden by their feet so long and crying such abject things those rotten hearted jails had made them as they slunk off in their rags and dragged their slipshod feet along the pavement Even of the three hundred prisoners who had escaped from Newgate there were some a few but there were some who sought their jailers out and delivered themselves up preferring imprisonment and punishment to the horrors of such another night as the last Many of the convicts drawn back to their old place of captivity by some indescribable attraction or by a desire to exult over it in its downfall and glut their revenge by seeing it in ashes actually went back in broad noon and loitered about the cells Fifty were retaken at one time on this next day within the prison walls but their fate did not deter others for there they went in spite of everything and there they were taken in twos and threes twice or thrice a day all through the week Of the fifty just mentioned some were occupied in endeavouring to rekindle the fire but in general they seemed to have no object in view but to prowl and lounge about the old place being often found asleep in the ruins or sitting talking there or even eating and drinking as in a choice retreat Besides the notices on the gates of the Fleet and the King s Bench many similar announcements were left before one o clock at noon at the houses of private individuals and further the mob proclaimed their intention of seizing on the Bank the Mint the Arsenal at Woolwich and the Royal Palaces The notices were seldom delivered by more than one man who if it were at a shop went in and laid it with a bloody threat perhaps upon the counter or if it were at a private house knocked at the door and thrust it in the servant s hand Notwithstanding the presence of the military in every quarter of the town and the great force in the Park these messengers did their errands with impunity all through the day So did two boys who went down Holborn alone armed with bars taken from the railings of Lord Mansfield s house and demanded money for the rioters So did a tall man on horseback who made a collection for the same purpose in Fleet Street and refused to take anything but gold A rumour had now got into circulation too which diffused a greater dread all through London even than these publicly announced intentions of the rioters though all men knew that if they were successfully effected there must ensue a national bankruptcy and general ruin It was said that they meant to throw the gates of Bedlam open and let all the madmen loose This suggested such dreadful images to the people s minds and was indeed an act so fraught with new and unimaginable horrors in the contemplation that it beset them more than any loss or cruelty of which they could foresee the worst and drove many sane men nearly mad themselves So the day passed on the prisoners moving their goods people running to and fro in the streets carrying away their property groups standing in silence round the ruins all business suspended and the soldiers disposed as has been already mentioned remaining quite inactive So the day passed on and dreaded night drew near again At last at seven o clock in the evening the Privy Council issued a solemn proclamation that it was now necessary to employ the military and that the officers had most direct and effectual orders by an immediate exertion of their utmost force to repress the disturbances and warning all good subjects of the King to keep themselves their servants and apprentices within doors that night There was then delivered out to every soldier on duty thirty six rounds of powder and ball the drums beat and the whole force was under arms at sunset The City authorities stimulated by these vigorous measures held a Common Council passed a vote thanking the military associations who had tendered their aid to the civil authorities accepted it and placed them under the direction of the two sheriffs At the Queen s palace a double guard the yeomen on duty the groom porters and all other attendants were stationed in the passages and on the staircases at seven o clock with strict instructions to be watchful on their posts all night and all the doors were locked The gentlemen of the Temple and the other Inns mounted guard within their gates and strengthened them with the great stones of the pavement which they took up for the purpose In Lincoln s Inn they gave up the hall and commons to the Northumberland Militia under the command of Lord Algernon Percy in some few of the city wards the burgesses turned out and without making a very fierce show looked brave enough Some hundreds of stout gentlemen threw themselves armed to the teeth into the halls of the different companies double locked and bolted all the gates and dared the rioters among themselves to come on at their peril These arrangements being all made simultaneously or nearly so were completed by the time it got dark and then the streets were comparatively clear and were guarded at all the great corners and chief avenues by the troops while parties of the officers rode up and down in all directions ordering chance stragglers home and admonishing the residents to keep within their houses and if any firing ensued not to approach the windows More chains were drawn across such of the thoroughfares as were of a nature to favour the approach of a great crowd and at each of these points a considerable force was stationed All these precautions having been taken and it being now quite dark those in command awaited the result in some anxiety and not without a hope that such vigilant demonstrations might of themselves dishearten the populace and prevent any new outrages But in this reckoning they were cruelly mistaken for in half an hour or less as though the setting in of night had been their preconcerted signal the rioters having previously in small parties prevented the lighting of the street lamps rose like a great sea and that in so many places at once and with such inconceivable fury that those who had the direction of the troops knew not at first where to turn or what to do One after another new fires blazed up in every quarter of the town as though it were the intention of the insurgents to wrap the city in a circle of flames which contracting by degrees should burn the whole to ashes the crowd swarmed and roared in every street and none but rioters and soldiers being out of doors it seemed to the latter as if all London were arrayed against them and they stood alone against the town In two hours six and thirty fires were raging six and thirty great conflagrations among them the Borough Clink in Tooley Street the King s Bench the Fleet and the New Bridewell In almost every street there was a battle and in every quarter the muskets of the troops were heard above the shouts and tumult of the mob The firing began in the Poultry where the chain was drawn across the road where nearly a score of people were killed on the first discharge Their bodies having been hastily carried into St Mildred s Church by the soldiers the latter fired again and following fast upon the crowd who began to give way when they saw the execution that was done formed across Cheapside and charged them at the point of the bayonet The streets were now a dreadful spectacle The shouts of the rabble the shrieks of women the cries of the wounded and the constant firing formed a deafening and an awful accompaniment to the sights which every corner presented Wherever the road was obstructed by the chains there the fighting and the loss of life were greatest but there was hot work and bloodshed in almost every leading thoroughfare At Holborn Bridge and on Holborn Hill the confusion was greater than in any other part for the crowd that poured out of the city in two great streams one by Ludgate Hill and one by Newgate Street united at that spot and formed a mass so dense that at every volley the people seemed to fall in heaps At this place a large detachment of soldiery were posted who fired now up Fleet Market now up Holborn now up Snow Hill constantly raking the streets in each direction At this place too several large fires were burning so that all the terrors of that terrible night seemed to be concentrated in one spot Full twenty times the rioters headed by one man who wielded an axe in his right hand and bestrode a brewer s horse of great size and strength caparisoned with fetters taken out of Newgate which clanked and jingled as he went made an attempt to force a passage at this point and fire the vintner s house Full twenty times they were repulsed with loss of life and still came back again and though the fellow at their head was marked and singled out by all and was a conspicuous object as the only rioter on horseback not a man could hit him So surely as the smoke cleared away so surely there was he calling hoarsely to his companions brandishing his axe above his head and dashing on as though he bore a charmed life and was proof against ball and powder This man was Hugh and in every part of the riot he was seen He headed two attacks upon the Bank helped to break open the Toll houses on Blackfriars Bridge and cast the money into the street fired two of the prisons with his own hand was here and there and everywhere always foremost always active striking at the soldiers cheering on the crowd making his horse s iron music heard through all the yell and uproar but never hurt or stopped Turn him at one place and he made a new struggle in anotlter force him to retreat at this point and he advanced on that directly Driven from Holborn for the twentieth time he rode at the head of a great crowd straight upon Saint Paul s attacked a guard of soldiers who kept watch over a body of prisoners within the iron railings forced them to retreat rescued the men they had in custody and with this accession to his party came back again mad with liquor and excitement and hallooing them on like a demon It would have been no easy task for the most careful rider to sit a horse in the midst of such a throng and tumult but though this madman rolled upon his back he had no saddle like a boat upon the sea he never for an instant lost his seat or failed to guide him where he would Through the very thickest of the press over dead bodies and burning fragments now on the pavement now in the road now riding up a flight of steps to make himself the more conspicuous to his party and now forcing a passage through a mass of human beings so closely squeezed together that it seemed as if the edge of a knife would scarcely part them on he went as though he could surmount all obstacles by the mere exercise of his will And perhaps his not being shot was in some degree attributable to this very circumstance for his extreme audacity and the conviction that he must be one of those to whom the proclamation referred inspired the soldiers with a desire to take him alive and diverted many an aim which otherwise might have been more near the mark The vintner and Mr Haredale unable to sit quietly listening to the noise without seeing what went on had climbed to the roof of the house and hiding behind a stack of chimneys were looking cautiously down into the street almost hoping that after so many repulses the rioters would be foiled when a great shout proclaimed that a parry were coming round the other way and the dismal jingling of those accursed fetters warned them next moment that they too were led by Hugh The soldiers had advanced into Fleet Market and were dispersing the people there so that they came on with hardly any check and were soon before the house All s over now said the vintner Fifty thousand pounds will be scattered in a minute We must save ourselves We can do no more and shall have reason to be thankful if we do as much Their first impulse was to clamber along the roofs of the houses and knocking at some garret window for admission pass down that way into the street and so escape But another fierce cry from below and a general upturning of the faces of the crowd apprised them that they were discovered and even that Mr Haredale was recognised for Hugh seeing him plainly in the bright glare of the fire which in that part made it as light as day called to him by his name and swore to have his life Leave me here said Mr Haredale and in Heaven s name my good friend save yourself Come on he muttered as he turned towards Hugh and faced him without any further effort at concealment This roof is high and if we close we will die together Madness said the honest vintner pulling him back sheer madness Hear reason sir My good sir hear reason I could never make myself heard by knocking at a window now and even if I could no one would be bold enough to connive at my escape Through the cellars there s a kind of passage into the back street by which we roll casks in and out We shall have time to get down there before they can force an entry Do not delay an instant but come with me for both our sakes for mine my dear good sir As he spoke and drew Mr Haredale back they had both a glimpse of the street It was but a glimpse but it showed them the crowd gathering and clustering round the house some of the armed men pressing to the front to break down the doors and windows some bringing brands from the nearest fire some with lifted faces following their course upon the roof and pointing them out to their companions all raging and roaring like the flames they lighted up They saw some men thirsting for the treasures of strong liquor which they knew were stored within they saw others who had been wounded sinking down into the opposite doorways and dying solitary wretches in the midst of all the vast assemblage here a frightened woman trying to escape and there a lost child and there a drunken ruffian unconscious of the death wound on his head raving and fighting to the last All these things and even such trivial incidents as a man with his hat off or turning round or stooping down or shaking hands with another they marked distinctly yet in a glance so brief that in the act of stepping back they lost the whole and saw but the pale faces of each other and the red sky above them Mr Haredale yielded to the entreaties of his companion more because he was resolved to defend him than for any thought he had of his own life or any care he entertained for his own safety and quickly re entering the house they descended the stairs together Loud blows were thundering on the shutters crowbars were already thrust beneath the door the glass fell from the sashes a deep light shone through every crevice and they heard the voices of the foremost in the crowd so close to every chink and keyhole that they seemed to be hoarsely whispering their threats into their very ears They had but a moment reached the bottom of the cellar steps and shut the door behind them when the mob broke in The vaults were profoundly dark and having no torch or candle for they had been afraid to carry one lest it should betray their place of refuge they were obliged to grope with their hands But they were not long without light for they had not gone far when they heard the crowd forcing the door and looking back among the low arched passages could see them in the distance hurrying to and fro with flashing links broaching the casks staving the great vats turning off upon the right hand and the left into the different cellars and lying down to drink at the channels of strong spirits which were already flowing on the ground They hurried on not the less quickly for this and had reached the only vault which lay between them and the passage out when suddenly from the direction in which they were going a strong light gleamed upon their faces and before they could slip aside or turn back or hide themselves two men one bearing a torch came upon them and cried in an astonished whisper Here they are At the same instant they pulled off what they wore upon their heads Mr Haredale saw before him Edward Chester and then saw when the vintner gasped his name Joe Willet Ay the same Joe though with an arm the less who used to make the quarterly journey on the grey mare to pay the bill to the purple faced vintner and that very same purple faced vintner formerly of Thames Street now looked him in the face and challenged him by name Give me your hand said Joe softly taking it whether the astonished vintner would or no Don t fear to shake it it s a friendly one and a hearty one though it has no fellow Why how well you look and how bluff you are And you God bless you sir Take heart take heart We ll find them Be of good cheer we have not been idle There was something so honest and frank in Joe s speech that Mr Haredale put his hand in his involuntarily though their meeting was suspicious enough But his glance at Edward Chester and that gentleman s keeping aloof were not lost upon Joe who said bluntly glancing at Edward while he spoke Times are changed Mr Haredale and times have come when we ought to know friends from enemies and make no confusion of names Let me tell you that but for this gentleman you would most likely have been dead by this time or badly wounded at the best What do you say cried Mr Haredale I say said Joe first that it was a bold thing to be in the crowd at all disguised as one of them though I won t say much about that on second thoughts for that s my case too Secondly that it was a brave and glorious action that s what I call it to strike that fellow off his horse before their eyes What fellow Whose eyes What fellow sir cried Joe a fellow who has no goodwill to you and who has the daring and devilry in him of twenty fellows I know him of old Once in the house HE would have found you here or anywhere The rest owe you no particular grudge and unless they see you will only think of drinking themselves dead But we lose time Are you ready Quite said Edward Put out the torch Joe and go on And be silent there s a good fellow Silent or not silent murmured Joe as he dropped the flaring link upon the ground crushed it with his foot and gave his hand to Mr Haredale it was a brave and glorious action no man can alter that Both Mr Haredale and the worthy vintner were too amazed and too much hurried to ask any further questions so followed their conductors in silence It seemed from a short whispering which presently ensued between them and the vintner relative to the best way of escape that they had entered by the back door with the connivance of John Grueby who watched outside with the key in his pocket and whom they had taken into their confidence A party of the crowd coming up that way just as they entered John had double locked the door again and made off for the soldiers so that means of retreat was cut off from under them However as the front door had been forced and this minor crowd being anxious to get at the liquor had no fancy for losing time in breaking down another but had gone round and got in from Holborn with the rest the narrow lane in the rear was quite free of people So when they had crawled through the passage indicated by the vintner which was a mere shelving trap for the admission of casks and had managed with some difficulty to unchain and raise the door at the upper end they emerged into the street without being observed or interrupted Joe still holding Mr Haredale tight and Edward taking the same care of the vintner they hurried through the streets at a rapid pace occasionally standing aside to let some fugitives go by or to keep out of the way of the soldiers who followed them and whose questions when they halted to put any were speedily stopped by one whispered word from Joe Chapter 68 While Newgate was burning on the previous night Barnaby and his father having been passed among the crowd from hand to hand stood in Smithfield on the outskirts of the mob gazing at the flames like men who had been suddenly roused from sleep Some moments elapsed before they could distinctly remember where they were or how they got there or recollected that while they were standing idle and listless spectators of the fire they had tools in their hands which had been hurriedly given them that they might free themselves from their fetters Barnaby heavily ironed as he was if he had obeyed his first impulse or if he had been alone would have made his way back to the side of Hugh who to his clouded intellect now shone forth with the new lustre of being his preserver and truest friend But his father s terror of remaining in the streets communicated itself to him when he comprehended the full extent of his fears and impressed him with the same eagerness to fly to a place of safety In a corner of the market among the pens for cattle Barnaby knelt down and pausing every now and then to pass his hand over his father s face or look up to him with a smile knocked off his irons When he had seen him spring a free man to his feet and had given vent to the transport of delight which the sight awakened he went to work upon his own which soon fell rattling down upon the ground and left his limbs unfettered Gliding away together when this task was accomplished and passing several groups of men each gathered round a stooping figure to hide him from those who passed but unable to repress the clanking sound of hammers which told that they too were busy at the same work the two fugitives made towards Clerkenwell and passing thence to Islington as the nearest point of egress were quickly in the fields After wandering about for a long time they found in a pasture near Finchley a poor shed with walls of mud and roof of grass and brambles built for some cowherd but now deserted Here they lay down for the rest of the night They wandered to and fro when it was day and once Barnaby went off alone to a cluster of little cottages two or three miles away to purchase some bread and milk But finding no better shelter they returned to the same place and lay down again to wait for night Heaven alone can tell with what vague hopes of duty and affection with what strange promptings of nature intelligible to him as to a man of radiant mind and most enlarged capacity with what dim memories of children he had played with when a child himself who had prattled of their fathers and of loving them and being loved with how many half remembered dreamy associations of his mother s grief and tears and widowhood he watched and tended this man But that a vague and shadowy crowd of such ideas came slowly on him that they taught him to be sorry when he looked upon his haggard face that they overflowed his eyes when he stooped to kiss him that they kept him waking in a tearful gladness shading him from the sun fanning him with leaves soothing him when he started in his sleep ah what a troubled sleep it was and wondering when SHE would come to join them and be happy is the truth He sat beside him all that day listening for her footsteps in every breath of air looking for her shadow on the gently waving grass twining the hedge flowers for her pleasure when she came and his when he awoke and stooping down from time to time to listen to his mutterings and wonder why he was so restless in that quiet place The sun went down and night came on and he was still quite tranquil busied with these thoughts as if there were no other people in the world and the dull cloud of smoke hanging on the immense city in the distance hid no vices no crimes no life or death or cause of disquiet nothing but clear air But the hour had now come when he must go alone to find out the blind man a task that filled him with delight and bring him to that place taking especial care that he was not watched or followed on his way back He listened to the directions he must observe repeated them again and again and after twice or thrice returning to surprise his father with a light hearted laugh went forth at last upon his errand leaving Grip whom he had carried from the jail in his arms to his care Fleet of foot and anxious to return he sped swiftly on towards the city but could not reach it before the fires began and made the night angry with their dismal lustre When he entered the town it might be that he was changed by going there without his late companions and on no violent errand or by the beautiful solitude in which he had passed the day or by the thoughts that had come upon him but it seemed peopled by a legion of devils This flight and pursuit this cruel burning and destroying these dreadful cries and stunning noises were THEY the good lord s noble cause Though almost stupefied by the bewildering scene still be found the blind man s house It was shut up and tenantless He waited for a long while but no one came At last he withdrew and as he knew by this time that the soldiers were firing and many people must have been killed he went down into Holborn where he heard the great crowd was to try if he could find Hugh and persuade him to avoid the danger and return with him If he had been stunned and shocked before his horror was increased a thousandfold when he got into this vortex of the riot and not being an actor in the terrible spectacle had it all before his eyes But there in the midst towering above them all close before the house they were attacking now was Hugh on horseback calling to the rest Sickened by the sights surrounding him on every side and by the heat and roar and crash he forced his way among the crowd where many recognised him and with shouts pressed back to let him pass and in time was nearly up with Hugh who was savagely threatening some one but whom or what he said he could not in the great confusion understand At that moment the crowd forced their way into the house and Hugh it was impossible to see by what means in such a concourse fell headlong down Barnaby was beside him when he staggered to his feet It was well he made him hear his voice or Hugh with his uplifted axe would have cleft his skull in twain Barnaby you Whose hand was that that struck me down Not mine Whose I say whose he cried reeling back and looking wildly round What are you doing Where is he Show me You are hurt said Barnaby as indeed he was in the head both by the blow he had received and by his horse s hoof Come away with me As he spoke he took the horse s bridle in his hand turned him and dragged Hugh several paces This brought them out of the crowd which was pouring from the street into the vintner s cellars Where s where s Dennis said Hugh coming to a stop and checking Barnaby with his strong arm Where has he been all day What did he mean by leaving me as he did in the jail last night Tell me you d ye hear With a flourish of his dangerous weapon he fell down upon the ground like a log After a minute though already frantic with drinking and with the wound in his head he crawled to a stream of burning spirit which was pouring down the kennel and began to drink at it as if it were a brook of water Barnaby drew him away and forced him to rise Though he could neither stand nor walk he involuntarily staggered to his horse climbed upon his back and clung there After vainly attempting to divest the animal of his clanking trappings Barnaby sprung up behind him snatched the bridle turned into Leather Lane which was close at hand and urged the frightened horse into a heavy trot He looked back once before he left the street and looked upon a sight not easily to be erased even from his remembrance so long as he had life The vintner s house with a half a dozen others near at hand was one great glowing blaze All night no one had essayed to quench the flames or stop their progress but now a body of soldiers were actively engaged in pulling down two old wooden houses which were every moment in danger of taking fire and which could scarcely fail if they were left to burn to extend the conflagration immensely The tumbling down of nodding walls and heavy blocks of wood the hooting and the execrations of the crowd the distant firing of other military detachments the distracted looks and cries of those whose habitations were in danger the hurrying to and fro of frightened people with their goods the reflections in every quarter of the sky of deep red soaring flames as though the last day had come and the whole universe were burning the dust and smoke and drift of fiery particles scorching and kindling all it fell upon the hot unwholesome vapour the blight on everything the stars and moon and very sky obliterated made up such a sum of dreariness and ruin that it seemed as if the face of Heaven were blotted out and night in its rest and quiet and softened light never could look upon the earth again But there was a worse spectacle than this worse by far than fire and smoke or even the rabble s unappeasable and maniac rage The gutters of the street and every crack and fissure in the stones ran with scorching spirit which being dammed up by busy hands overflowed the road and pavement and formed a great pool into which the people dropped down dead by dozens They lay in heaps all round this fearful pond husbands and wives fathers and sons mothers and daughters women with children in their arms and babies at their breasts and drank until they died While some stooped with their lips to the brink and never raised their heads again others sprang up from their fiery draught and danced half in a mad triumph and half in the agony of suffocation until they fell and steeped their corpses in the liquor that had killed them Nor was even this the worst or most appalling kind of death that happened on this fatal night From the burning cellars where they drank out of hats pails buckets tubs and shoes some men were drawn alive but all alight from head to foot who in their unendurable anguish and suffering making for anything that had the look of water rolled hissing in this hideous lake and splashed up liquid fire which lapped in all it met with as it ran along the surface and neither spared the living nor the dead On this last night of the great riots for the last night it was the wretched victims of a senseless outcry became themselves the dust and ashes of the flames they had kindled and strewed the public streets of London With all he saw in this last glance fixed indelibly upon his mind Barnaby hurried from the city which enclosed such horrors and holding down his head that he might not even see the glare of the fires upon the quiet landscape was soon in the still country roads He stopped at about half a mile from the shed where his father lay and with some difficulty making Hugh sensible that he must dismount sunk the horse s furniture in a pool of stagnant water and turned the animal loose That done he supported his companion as well as he could and led him slowly forward Chapter 69 It was the dead of night and very dark when Barnaby with his stumbling comrade approached the place where he had left his father but he could see him stealing away into the gloom distrustful even of him and rapidly retreating After calling to him twice or thrice that there was nothing to fear but without effect he suffered Hugh to sink upon the ground and followed to bring him back He continued to creep away until Barnaby was close upon him then turned and said in a terrible though suppressed voice Let me go Do not lay hands upon me You have told her and you and she together have betrayed me Barnaby looked at him in silence You have seen your mother No cried Barnaby eagerly Not for a long time longer than I can tell A whole year I think Is she here His father looked upon him steadfastly for a few moments and then said drawing nearer to him as he spoke for seeing his face and hearing his words it was impossible to doubt his truth What man is that Hugh Hugh Only Hugh You know him HE will not harm you Why you re afraid of Hugh Ha ha ha Afraid of gruff old noisy Hugh What man is he I ask you he rejoined so fiercely that Barnaby stopped in his laugh and shrinking back surveyed him with a look of terrified amazement Why how stern you are You make me fear you though you are my father Why do you speak to me so I want he answered putting away the hand which his son with a timid desire to propitiate him laid upon his sleeve I want an answer and you give me only jeers and questions Who have you brought with you to this hiding place poor fool and where is the blind man I don t know where His house was close shut I waited but no person came that was no fault of mine This is Hugh brave Hugh who broke into that ugly jail and set us free Aha You like him now do you You like him now Why does he lie upon the ground He has had a fall and has been drinking The fields and trees go round and round and round with him and the ground heaves under his feet You know him You remember See They had by this time returned to where he lay and both stooped over him to look into his face I recollect the man his father murmured Why did you bring him here Because he would have been killed if I had left him over yonder They were firing guns and shedding blood Does the sight of blood turn you sick father I see it does by your face That s like me What are you looking at At nothing said the murderer softly as he started back a pace or two and gazed with sunken jaw and staring eyes above his son s head At nothing He remained in the same attitude and with the same expression on his face for a minute or more then glanced slowly round as if he had lost something and went shivering back towards the shed Shall I bring him in father asked Barnaby who had looked on wondering He only answered with a suppressed groan and lying down upon the ground wrapped his cloak about his head and shrunk into the darkest corner Finding that nothing would rouse Hugh now or make him sensible for a moment Barnaby dragged him along the grass and laid him on a little heap of refuse hay and straw which had been his own bed first having brought some water from a running stream hard by and washed his wound and laved his hands and face Then he lay down himself between the two to pass the night and looking at the stars fell fast asleep Awakened early in the morning by the sunshine and the songs of birds and hum of insects he left them sleeping in the hut and walked into the sweet and pleasant air But he felt that on his jaded senses oppressed and burdened with the dreadful scenes of last night and many nights before all the beauties of opening day which he had so often tasted and in which he had had such deep delight fell heavily He thought of the blithe mornings when he and the dogs went bounding on together through the woods and fields and the recollection filled his eyes with tears He had no consciousness God help him of having done wrong nor had he any new perception of the merits of the cause in which he had been engaged or those of the men who advocated it but he was full of cares now and regrets and dismal recollections and wishes quite unknown to him before that this or that event had never happened and that the sorrow and suffering of so many people had been spared And now he began to think how happy they would be his father mother he and Hugh if they rambled away together and lived in some lonely place where there were none of these troubles and that perhaps the blind man who had talked so wisely about gold and told him of the great secrets he knew could teach them how to live without being pinched by want As this occurred to him he was the more sorry that he had not seen him last night and he was still brooding over this regret when his father came and touched him on the shoulder Ah cried Barnaby starting from his fit of thoughtfulness Is it only you Who should it be I almost thought he answered it was the blind man I must have some talk with him father And so must I for without seeing him I don t know where to fly or what to do and lingering here is death You must go to him again and bring him here Must I cried Barnaby delighted that s brave father That s what I want to do But you must bring only him and none other And though you wait at his door a whole day and night still you must wait and not come back without him Don t you fear that he cried gaily He shall come he shall come Trim off these gewgaws said his father plucking the scraps of ribbon and the feathers from his hat and over your own dress wear my cloak Take heed how you go and they will be too busy in the streets to notice you Of your coming back you need take no account for he ll manage that safely To be sure said Barnaby To be sure he will A wise man father and one who can teach us to be rich Oh I know him I know him He was speedily dressed and as well disguised as he could be With a lighter heart he then set off upon his second journey leaving Hugh who was still in a drunken stupor stretched upon the ground within the shed and his father walking to and fro before it The murderer full of anxious thoughts looked after him and paced up and down disquieted by every breath of air that whispered among the boughs and by every light shadow thrown by the passing clouds upon the daisied ground He was anxious for his safe return and yet though his own life and safety hung upon it felt a relief while he was gone In the intense selfishness which the constant presence before him of his great crimes and their consequences here and hereafter engendered every thought of Barnaby as his son was swallowed up and lost Still his presence was a torture and reproach in his wild eyes there were terrible images of that guilty night with his unearthly aspect and his half formed mind he seemed to the murderer a creature who had sprung into existence from his victim s blood He could not bear his look his voice his touch and yet he was forced by his own desperate condition and his only hope of cheating the gibbet to have him by his side and to know that he was inseparable from his single chance of escape He walked to and fro with little rest all day revolving these things in his mind and still Hugh lay unconscious in the shed At length when the sun was setting Barnaby returned leading the blind man and talking earnestly to him as they came along together The murderer advanced to meet them and bidding his son go on and speak to Hugh who had just then staggered to his feet took his place at the blind man s elbow and slowly followed towards the shed Why did you send HIM said Stagg Don t you know it was the way to have him lost as soon as found Would you have had me come myself returned the other Humph Perhaps not I was before the jail on Tuesday night but missed you in the crowd I was out last night too There was good work last night gay work profitable work he added rattling the money in his pockets Have you Seen your good lady Yes Do you mean to tell me more or not I ll tell you all returned the blind man with a laugh Excuse me but I love to see you so impatient There s energy in it Does she consent to say the word that may save me No returned the blind man emphatically as he turned his face towards him No Thus it is She has been at death s door since she lost her darling has been insensible and I know not what I tracked her to a hospital and presented myself with your leave at her bedside Our talk was not a long one for she was weak and there being people near I was not quite easy But I told her all that you and I agreed upon and pointed out the young gentleman s position in strong terms She tried to soften me but that of course as I told her was lost time She cried and moaned you may be sure all women do Then of a sudden she found her voice and strength and said that Heaven would help her and her innocent son and that to Heaven she appealed against us which she did in really very pretty language I assure you I advised her as a friend not to count too much on assistance from any such distant quarter recommended her to think of it told her where I lived said I knew she would send to me before noon next day and left her either in a faint or shamming When he had concluded this narration during which he had made several pauses for the convenience of cracking and eating nuts of which he seemed to have a pocketful the blind man pulled a flask from his pocket took a draught himself and offered it to his companion You won t won t you he said feeling that he pushed it from him Well Then the gallant gentleman who s lodging with you will Hallo bully Death said the other holding him back Will you tell me what I am to do Do Nothing easier Make a moonlight flitting in two hours time with the young gentleman he s quite ready to go I have been giving him good advice as we came along and get as far from London as you can Let me know where you are and leave the rest to me She MUST come round she can t hold out long and as to the chances of your being retaken in the meanwhile why it wasn t one man who got out of Newgate but three hundred Think of that for your comfort We must support life How How repeated the blind man By eating and drinking And how get meat and drink but by paying for it Money he cried slapping his pocket Is money the word Why the streets have been running money Devil send that the sport s not over yet for these are jolly times golden rare roaring scrambling times Hallo bully Hallo Hallo Drink bully drink Where are ye there Hallo With such vociferations and with a boisterous manner which bespoke his perfect abandonment to the general licence and disorder he groped his way towards the shed where Hugh and Barnaby were sitting on the ground Put it about he cried handing his flask to Hugh The kennels run with wine and gold Guineas and strong water flow from the very pumps About with it don t spare it Exhausted unwashed unshorn begrimed with smoke and dust his hair clotted with blood his voice quite gone so that he spoke in whispers his skin parched up by fever his whole body bruised and cut and beaten about Hugh still took the flask and raised it to his lips He was in the act of drinking when the front of the shed was suddenly darkened and Dennis stood before them No offence no offence said that personage in a conciliatory tone as Hugh stopped in his draught an public entertainment situated in the fields at the back of the Foundling Hospital a very solitary spot at that period and quite deserted after dark The tavern stood at some distance from any high road and was approachable only by a dark and narrow lane so that Hugh was much surprised to find several people drinking there and great merriment going on He was still more surprised to find among them almost every face that had caught his attention in the crowd but his companion having whispered him outside the door that it was not considered good manners at The Boot to appear at all curious about the company he kept his own counsel and made no show of recognition Before putting his lips to the liquor which was brought for them Dennis drank in a loud voice the health of Lord George Gordon President of the Great Protestant Association which toast Hugh pledged likewise with corresponding enthusiasm A fiddler who was present and who appeared to act as the appointed minstrel of the company forthwith struck up a Scotch reel and that in tones so invigorating that Hugh and his friend who had both been drinking before rose from their seats as by previous concert and to the great admiration of the assembled guests performed an extemporaneous No Popery Dance Chapter 39 The applause which the performance of Hugh and his new friend elicited from the company at The Boot had not yet subsided and the two dancers were still panting from their exertions which had been of a rather extreme and violent character when the party was reinforced by the arrival of some more guests who being a detachment of United Bulldogs were received with very flattering marks of distinction and respect The leader of this small party for including himself they were but three in number was our old acquaintance Mr Tappertit who seemed physically speaking to have grown smaller with years particularly as to his legs which were stupendously little but who in a moral point of view in personal dignity and self esteem had swelled into a giant Nor was it by any means difficult for the most unobservant person to detect this state of feeling in the quondam prentice for it not only proclaimed itself impressively and beyond mistake in his majestic walk and kindling eye but found a striking means of revelation in his turned up nose which scouted all things of earth with deep disdain and sought communion with its kindred skies Mr Tappertit as chief or captain of the Bulldogs was attended by his two lieutenants one the tall comrade of his younger life the other a Prentice Knight in days of yore Mark Gilbert bound in the olden time to Thomas Curzon of the Golden Fleece These gentlemen like himself were now emancipated from their prentice thraldom and served as journeymen but they were in humble emulation of his great example bold and daring spirits and aspired to a distinguished state in great political events Hence their connection with the Protestant Association of England sanctioned by the name of Lord George Gordon and hence their present visit to The Boot Gentlemen said Mr Tappertit taking off his hat as a great general might in addressing his troops Well met My lord does me and you the honour to send his compliments per self You ve seen my lord too have you said Dennis I see him this afternoon My duty called me to the Lobby when our shop shut up and I saw him there sir Mr Tappertit replied as he and his lieutenants took their seats How do YOU do Lively master lively said the fellow Here s a new brother regularly put down in black and white by Muster Gashford a credit to the cause one of the stick at nothing sort one arter my own heart D ye see him Has he got the looks of a man that ll do do you think he cried as he slapped Hugh on the back Looks or no looks said Hugh with a drunken flourish of his arm I m the man you want I hate the Papists every one of em They hate me and I hate them They do me all the harm they can and I ll do them all the harm I can Hurrah Was there ever said Dennis looking round the room when the echo of his boisterous voice bad died away was there ever such a game boy Why I mean to say brothers that if Muster Gashford had gone a hundred mile and got together fifty men of the common run they wouldn t have been worth this one The greater part of the company implicitly subscribed to this opinion and testified their faith in Hugh by nods and looks of great significance Mr Tappertit sat and contemplated him for a long time in silence as if he suspended his judgment then drew a little nearer to him and eyed him over more carefully then went close up to him and took him apart into a dark corner I say he began with a thoughtful brow haven t I seen you before It s like you may said Hugh in his careless way I don t know shouldn t wonder No but it s very easily settled returned Sim Look at me Did you ever see ME before You wouldn t be likely to forget it you know if you ever did Look at me Don t be afraid I won t do you any harm Take a good look steady now The encouraging way in which Mr Tappertit made this request and coupled it with an assurance that he needn t be frightened amused Hugh mightily so much indeed that be saw nothing at all of the small man before him through closing his eyes in a fit of hearty laughter which shook his great broad sides until they ached again Come said Mr Tappertit growing a little impatient under this disrespectful treatment Do you know me feller Not I cried Hugh Ha ha ha Not I But I should like to And yet I d have wagered a seven shilling piece said Mr Tappertit folding his arms and confronting him with his legs wide apart and firmly planted on the ground that you once were hostler at the Maypole Hugh opened his eyes on hearing this and looked at him in great surprise And so you were too said Mr Tappertit pushing him away with a condescending playfulness When did MY eyes ever deceive unless it was a young woman Don t you know me now Why it an t Hugh faltered An t it said Mr Tappertit Are you sure of that You remember G Varden don t you Certainly Hugh did and he remembered D Varden too but that he didn t tell him You remember coming down there before I was out of my time to ask after a vagabond that had bolted off and left his disconsolate father a prey to the bitterest emotions and all the rest of it don t you said Mr Tappertit Of course I do cried Hugh And I saw you there Saw me there said Mr Tappertit Yes I should think you did see me there The place would be troubled to go on without me Don t you remember my thinking you liked the vagabond and on that account going to quarrel with you and then finding you detested him worse than poison going to drink with you Don t you remember that To be sure cried Hugh Well and are you in the same mind now said Mr Tappertit Yes roared Hugh You speak like a man said Mr Tappertit and I ll shake hands with you With these conciliatory expressions he suited the action to the word and Hugh meeting his advances readily they performed the ceremony with a show of great heartiness I find said Mr Tappertit looking round on the assembled guests that brother What s his name and I are old acquaintance You never heard anything more of that rascal I suppose eh Not a syllable replied Hugh I never want to I don t believe I ever shall He s dead long ago I hope It s to be hoped for the sake of mankind in general and the happiness of society that he is said Mr Tappertit rubbing his palm upon his legs and looking at it between whiles Is your other hand at all cleaner Much the same Well I ll owe you another shake We ll suppose it done if you ve no objection Hugh laughed again and with such thorough abandonment to his mad humour that his limbs seemed dislocated and his whole frame in danger of tumbling to pieces but Mr Tappertit so far from receiving this extreme merriment with any irritation was pleased to regard it with the utmost favour and even to join in it so far as one of his gravity and station could with any regard to that decency and decorum which men in high places are expected to maintain Mr Tappertit did not stop here as many public characters might have done but calling up his brace of lieutenants introduced Hugh to them with high commendation declaring him to be a man who at such times as those in which they lived could not be too much cherished Further he did him the honour to remark that he would be an acquisition of which even the United Bulldogs might be proud and finding upon sounding him that he was quite ready and willing to enter the society for he was not at all particular and would have leagued himself that night with anything or anybody for any purpose whatsoever caused the necessary preliminaries to be gone into upon the spot This tribute to his great merit delighted no man more than Mr Dennis as he himself proclaimed with several rare and surprising oaths and indeed it gave unmingled satisfaction to the whole assembly Make anything you like of me cried Hugh flourishing the can he had emptied more than once Put me on any duty you please I m your man I ll do it Here s my captain here s my leader Ha ha ha Let him give me the word of command and I ll fight the whole Parliament House single handed or set a lighted torch to the King s Throne itself With that he smote Mr Tappertit on the back with such violence that his little body seemed to shrink into a mere nothing and roared again until the very foundlings near at hand were startled in their beds In fact a sense of something whimsical in their companionship seemed to have taken entire possession of his rude brain The bare fact of being patronised by a great man whom he could have crushed with one hand appeared in his eyes so eccentric and humorous that a kind of ferocious merriment gained the mastery over him and quite subdued his brutal nature He roared and roared again toasted Mr Tappertit a hundred times declared himself a Bulldog to the core and vowed to be faithful to him to the last drop of blood in his veins All these compliments Mr Tappertit received as matters of course flattering enough in their way but entirely attributable to his vast superiority His dignified self possession only delighted Hugh the more and in a word this giant and dwarf struck up a friendship which bade fair to be of long continuance as the one held it to be his right to command and the other considered it an exquisite pleasantry to obey Nor was Hugh by any means a passive follower who scrupled to act without precise and definite orders for when Mr Tappertit mounted on an empty cask which stood by way of rostrum in the room and volunteered a speech upon the alarming crisis then at hand he placed himself beside the orator and though he grinned from ear to ear at every word he said threw out such expressive hints to scoffers in the management of his cudgel that those who were at first the most disposed to interrupt became remarkably attentive and were the loudest in their approbation It was not all noise and jest however at The Boot nor were the whole party listeners to the speech There were some men at the other end of the room which was a long low roofed chamber in earnest conversation all the time and when any of this group went out fresh people were sure to come in soon afterwards and sit down in their places as though the others had relieved them on some watch or duty which it was pretty clear they did for these changes took place by the clock at intervals of half an hour These persons whispered very much among themselves and kept aloof and often looked round as jealous of their speech being overheard some two or three among them entered in books what seemed to be reports from the others when they were not thus employed one of them would turn to the newspapers which were strewn upon the table and from the St James s Chronicle the Herald Chronicle or Public Advertiser would read to the rest in a low voice some passage having reference to the topic in which they were all so deeply interested But the great attraction was a pamphlet called The Thunderer which espoused their own opinions and was supposed at that time to emanate directly from the Association This was always in request and whether read aloud to an eager knot of listeners or by some solitary man was certain to be followed by stormy talking and excited looks In the midst of all his merriment and admiration of his captain Hugh was made sensible by these and other tokens of the presence of an air of mystery akin to that which had so much impressed him out of doors It was impossible to discard a sense that something serious was going on and that under the noisy revel of the public house there lurked unseen and dangerous matter Little affected by this however he was perfectly satisfied with his quarters and would have remained there till morning but that his conductor rose soon after midnight to go home Mr Tappertit following his example left him no excuse to stay So they all three left the house together roaring a No Popery song until the fields resounded with the dismal noise Cheer up captain cried Hugh when they had roared themselves out of breath Another stave Mr Tappertit nothing loath began again and so the three went staggering on arm in arm shouting like madmen and defying the watch with great valour Indeed this did not require any unusual bravery or boldness as the watchmen of that time being selected for the office on account of excessive age and extraordinary infirmity had a custom of shutting themselves up tight in their boxes on the first symptoms of disturbance and remaining there until they disappeared In these proceedings Mr Dennis who had a gruff voice and lungs of considerable power distinguished himself very much and acquired great credit with his two companions What a queer fellow you are said Mr Tappertit You re so precious sly and close Why don t you ever tell what trade you re of Answer the captain instantly cried Hugh beating his hat down on his head why don t you ever tell what trade you re of I m of as gen teel a calling brother as any man in England as light a business as any gentleman could desire Was you prenticed to it asked Mr Tappertit No Natural genius said Mr Dennis No prenticing It come by natur Muster Gashford knows my calling Look at that hand of mine many and many a job that hand has done with a neatness and dex terity never known afore When I look at that hand said Mr Dennis shaking it in the air and remember the helegant bits of work it has turned off I feel quite molloncholy to think it should ever grow old and feeble But sich is life He heaved a deep sigh as he indulged in these reflections and putting his fingers with an absent air on Hugh s throat and particularly under his left ear as if he were studying the anatomical development of that part of his frame shook his head in a despondent manner and actually shed tears You re a kind of artist I suppose eh said Mr Tappertit Yes rejoined Dennis yes I may call myself a artist a fancy workman art improves natur that s my motto And what do you call this said Mr Tappertit taking his stick out of his hand That s my portrait atop Dennis replied d ye think it s like Why it s a little too handsome said Mr Tappertit Who did it You I repeated Dennis gazing fondly on his image I wish I had the talent That was carved by a friend of mine as is now no more The very day afore he died he cut that with his pocket knife from memory I ll die game says my friend and my last moments shall be dewoted to making Dennis s picter That s it That was a queer fancy wasn t it said Mr Tappertit It WAS a queer fancy rejoined the other breathing on his fictitious nose and polishing it with the cuff of his coat but he was a queer subject altogether a kind of gipsy one of the finest stand up men you ever see Ah He told me some things that would startle you a bit did that friend of mine on the morning when he died You were with him at the time were you said Mr Tappertit Yes he answered with a curious look I was there Oh yes certainly I was there He wouldn t have gone off half as comfortable without me I had been with three or four of his family under the same circumstances They were all fine fellows They must have been fond of you remarked Mr Tappertit looking at him sideways I don t know that they was exactly fond of me said Dennis with a little hesitation but they all had me near em when they departed I come in for their wardrobes too This very handkecher that you see round my neck belonged to him that I ve been speaking of him as did that likeness Mr Tappertit glanced at the article referred to and appeared to think that the deceased s ideas of dress were of a peculiar and by no means an expensive kind He made no remark upon the point however and suffered his mysterious companion to proceed without interruption These smalls said Dennis rubbing his legs these very smalls they belonged to a friend of mine that s left off sich incumbrances for ever this coat too I ve often walked behind this coat in the street and wondered whether it would ever come to me this pair of shoes have danced a hornpipe for another man afore my eyes full half a dozen times at least and as to my hat he said taking it off and whirling it round upon his fist Lord I ve seen this hat go up Holborn on the box of a hackney coach ah many and many a day You don t mean to say their old wearers are ALL dead I hope said Mr Tappertit falling a little distance from him as he spoke Every one of em replied Dennis Every man Jack There was something so very ghastly in this circumstance and it appeared to account in such a very strange and dismal manner for his faded dress which in this new aspect seemed discoloured by the earth from graves that Mr Tappertit abruptly found he was going another way and stopping short bade him good night with the utmost heartiness As they happened to be near the Old Bailey and Mr Dennis knew there were turnkeys in the lodge with whom he could pass the night and discuss professional subjects of common interest among them before a rousing fire and over a social glass he separated from his companions without any great regret and warmly shaking hands with Hugh and making an early appointment for their meeting at The Boot left them to pursue their road That s a strange sort of man said Mr Tappertit watching the hackney coachman s hat as it went bobbing down the street I don t know what to make of him Why can t he have his smalls made to order or wear live clothes at any rate He s a lucky man captain cried Hugh I should like to have such friends as his I hope he don t get em to make their wills and then knock em on the head said Mr Tappertit musing But come The United B s expect me On What s the matter I quite forgot said Hugh who had started at the striking of a neighbouring clock I have somebody to see to night I must turn back directly The drinking and singing put it out of my head It s well I remembered it Mr Tappertit looked at him as though he were about to give utterance to some very majestic sentiments in reference to this act of desertion but as it was clear from Hugh s hasty manner that the engagement was one of a pressing nature he graciously forbore and gave him his permission to depart immediately which Hugh acknowledged with a roar of laughter Good night captain he cried I am yours to the death remember Farewell said Mr Tappertit waving his hand Be bold and vigilant No Popery captain roared Hugh England in blood first cried his desperate leader Whereat Hugh cheered and laughed and ran off like a greyhound That man will prove a credit to my corps said Simon turning thoughtfully upon his heel And let me see In an altered state of society which must ensue if we break out and are victorious when the locksmith s child is mine Miggs must be got rid of somehow or she ll poison the tea kettle one evening when I m out He might marry Miggs if he was drunk enough It shall be done I ll make a note of it Chapter 40 Little thinking of the plan for his happy settlement in life which had suggested itself to the teeming brain of his provident commander Hugh made no pause until Saint Dunstan s giants struck the hour above him when he worked the handle of a pump which stood hard by with great vigour and thrusting his head under the spout let the water gush upon him until a little stream ran down from every uncombed hair and he was wet to the waist Considerably refreshed by this ablution both in mind and body and almost sobered for the time he dried himself as he best could then crossed the road and plied the knocker of the Middle Temple gate The night porter looked through a small grating in the portal with a surly eye and cried Halloa which greeting Hugh returned in kind and bade him open quickly We don t sell beer here cried the man what else do you want To come in Hugh replied with a kick at the door Where to go Paper Buildings Whose chambers Sir John Chester s Each of which answers he emphasised with another kick After a little growling on the other side the gate was opened and he passed in undergoing a close inspection from the porter as he did so YOU wanting Sir John at this time of night said the man Ay said Hugh I What of that Why I must go with you and see that you do for I don t believe it Come along then Eyeing him with suspicious looks the man with key and lantern walked on at his side and attended him to Sir John Chester s door at which Hugh gave one knock that echoed through the dark staircase like a ghostly summons and made the dull light tremble in the drowsy lamp Do you think he wants me now said Hugh Before the man had time to answer a footstep was heard within a light appeared and Sir John in his dressing gown and slippers opened the door I ask your pardon Sir John said the porter pulling off his hat Here s a young man says he wants to speak to you It s late for strangers I thought it best to see that all was right Aha cried Sir John raising his eyebrows It s you messenger is it Go in Quite right friend I commend your prudence highly Thank you God bless you Good night To be commended thanked God blessed and bade good night by one who carried Sir before his name and wrote himself M P to boot was something for a porter He withdrew with much humility and reverence Sir John followed his late visitor into the dressing room and sitting in his easy chair before the fire and moving it so that he could see him as he stood hat in hand beside the door looked at him from head to foot The old face calm and pleasant as ever the complexion quite juvenile in its bloom and clearness the same smile the wonted precision and elegance of dress the white well ordered teeth the delicate hands the composed and quiet manner everything as it used to be no mark of age or passion envy hate or discontent all unruffled and serene and quite delightful to behold He wrote himself M P but how Why thus It was a proud family more proud indeed than wealthy He had stood in danger of arrest of bailiffs and a jail a vulgar jail to which the common people with small incomes went Gentlemen of ancient houses have no privilege of exemption from such cruel laws unless they are of one great house and then they have A proud man of his stock and kindred had the means of sending him there He offered not indeed to pay his debts but to let him sit for a close borough until his own son came of age which if he lived would come to pass in twenty years It was quite as good as an Insolvent Act and infinitely more genteel So Sir John Chester was a member of Parliament But how Sir John Nothing so simple or so easy One touch with a sword of state and the transformation was effected John Chester Esquire M P attended court went up with an address headed a deputation Such elegance of manner so many graces of deportment such powers of conversation could never pass unnoticed Mr was too common for such merit A man so gentlemanly should have been but Fortune is capricious born a Duke just as some dukes should have been born labourers He caught the fancy of the king knelt down a grub and rose a butterfly John Chester Esquire was knighted and became Sir John I thought when you left me this evening my esteemed acquaintance said Sir John after a pretty long silence that you intended to return with all despatch So I did master And so you have he retorted glancing at his watch Is that what you would say Instead of replying Hugh changed the leg on which he leant shuffled his cap from one hand to the other looked at the ground the wall the ceiling and finally at Sir John himself before whose pleasant face he lowered his eyes again and fixed them on the floor And how have you been employing yourself in the meanwhile quoth Sir John lazily crossing his legs Where have you been what harm have you been doing No harm at all master growled Hugh with humility I have only done as you ordered As I WHAT returned Sir John Well then said Hugh uneasily as you advised or said I ought or said I might or said that you would do if you was me Don t be so hard upon me master Something like an expression of triumph in the perfect control he had established over this rough instrument appeared in the knight s face for an instant but it vanished directly as he said paring his nails while speaking When you say I ordered you my good fellow you imply that I directed you to do something for me something I wanted done something for my own ends and purposes you see Now I am sure I needn t enlarge upon the extreme absurdity of such an idea however unintentional so please and here he turned his eyes upon him to be more guarded Will you I meant to give you no offence said Hugh I don t know what to say You catch me up so very short You will be caught up much shorter my good friend infinitely shorter one of these days depend upon it replied his patron calmly By the bye instead of wondering why you have been so long my wonder should be why you came at all Why did you You know master said Hugh that I couldn t read the bill I found and that supposing it to be something particular from the way it was wrapped up I brought it here And could you ask no one else to read it Bruin said Sir John No one that I could trust with secrets master Since Barnaby Rudge was lost sight of for good and all and that s five years ago I haven t talked with any one but you You have done me honour I am sure I have come to and fro master all through that time when there was anything to tell because I knew that you d be angry with me if I stayed away said Hugh blurting the words out after an embarrassed silence and because I wished to please you if I could and not to have you go against me There That s the true reason why I came to night You know that master I am sure You are a specious fellow returned Sir John fixing his eyes upon him and carry two faces under your hood as well as the best Didn t you give me in this room this evening any other reason no dislike of anybody who has slighted you lately on all occasions abused you treated you with rudeness acted towards you more as if you were a mongrel dog than a man like himself To be sure I did cried Hugh his passion rising as the other meant it should and I say it all over now again I d do anything to have some revenge on him anything And when you told me that he and all the Catholics would suffer from those who joined together under that handbill I said I d make one of em if their master was the devil himself I AM one of em See whether I am as good as my word and turn out to be among the foremost or no I mayn t have much head master but I ve head enough to remember those that use me ill You shall see and so shall he and so shall hundreds more how my spirit backs me when the time comes My bark is nothing to my bite Some that I know had better have a wild lion among em than me when I am fairly loose they had The knight looked at him with a smile of far deeper meaning than ordinary and pointing to the old cupboard followed him with his eyes while he filled and drank a glass of liquor and smiled when his back was turned with deeper meaning yet You are in a blustering mood my friend he said when Hugh confronted him again Not I master cried Hugh I don t say half I mean I can t I haven t got the gift There are talkers enough among us I ll be one of the doers Oh you have joined those fellows then said Sir John with an air of most profound indifference Yes I went up to the house you told me of and got put down upon the muster There was another man there named Dennis Dennis eh cried Sir John laughing Ay ay a pleasant fellow I believe A roaring dog master one after my own heart hot upon the matter too red hot So I have heard replied Sir John carelessly You don t happen to know his trade do you He wouldn t say cried Hugh He keeps it secret Ha ha laughed Sir John A strange fancy a weakness with some persons you ll know it one day I dare swear We re intimate already said Hugh Quite natural And have been drinking together eh pursued Sir John Did you say what place you went to in company when you left Lord George s Hugh had not said or thought of saying but he told him and this inquiry being followed by a long train of questions he related all that had passed both in and out of doors the kind of people he had seen their numbers state of feeling mode of conversation apparent expectations and intentions His questioning was so artfully contrived that he seemed even in his own eyes to volunteer all this information rather than to have it wrested from him and he was brought to this state of feeling so naturally that when Mr Chester yawned at length and declared himself quite wearied out he made a rough kind of excuse for having talked so much There get you gone said Sir John holding the door open in his hand You have made a pretty evening s work I told you not to do this You may get into trouble You ll have an opportunity of revenging yourself on your proud friend Haredale though and for that you d hazard anything I suppose I would retorted Hugh stopping in his passage out and looking back but what do I risk What do I stand a chance of losing master Friends home A fig for em all I have none they are nothing to me Give me a good scuffle let me pay off old scores in a bold riot where there are men to stand by me and then use me as you like it don t matter much to me what the end is What have you done with that paper said Sir John I have it here master Drop it again as you go along it s as well not to keep such things about you Hugh nodded and touching his cap with an air of as much respect as he could summon up departed Sir John fastening the doors behind him went back to his dressing room and sat down once again before the fire at which he gazed for a long time in earnest meditation This happens fortunately he said breaking into a smile and promises well Let me see My relative and I who are the most Protestant fellows in the world give our worst wishes to the Roman Catholic cause and to Saville who introduces their bill I have a personal objection besides but as each of us has himself for the first article in his creed we cannot commit ourselves by joining with a very extravagant madman such as this Gordon most undoubtedly is Now really to foment his disturbances in secret through the medium of such a very apt instrument as my savage friend here may further our real ends and to express at all becoming seasons in moderate and polite terms a disapprobation of his proceedings though we agree with him in principle will certainly be to gain a character for honesty and uprightness of purpose which cannot fail to do us infinite service and to raise us into some importance Good So much for public grounds As to private considerations I confess that if these vagabonds WOULD make some riotous demonstration which does not appear impossible and WOULD inflict some little chastisement on Haredale as a not inactive man among his sect it would be extremely agreeable to my feelings and would amuse me beyond measure Good again Perhaps better When he came to this point he took a pinch of snuff then beginning slowly to undress he resumed his meditations by saying with a smile I fear I DO fear exceedingly that my friend is following fast in the footsteps of his mother His intimacy with Mr Dennis is very ominous But I have no doubt he must have come to that end any way If I lend him a helping hand the only difference is that he may upon the whole possibly drink a few gallons or puncheons or hogsheads less in this life than he otherwise would It s no business of mine It s a matter of very small importance So he took another pinch of snuff and went to bed Chapter 41 From the workshop of the Golden Key there issued forth a tinkling sound so merry and good humoured that it suggested the idea of some one working blithely and made quite pleasant music No man who hammered on at a dull monotonous duty could have brought such cheerful notes from steel and iron none but a chirping healthy honest hearted fellow who made the best of everything and felt kindly towards everybody could have done it for an instant He might have been a coppersmith and still been musical If he had sat in a jolting waggon full of rods of iron it seemed as if he would have brought some harmony out of it Tink tink tink clear as a silver bell and audible at every pause of the streets harsher noises as though it said I don t care nothing puts me out I am resolved to he happy Women scolded children squalled heavy carts went rumbling by horrible cries proceeded from the lungs of hawkers still it struck in again no higher no lower no louder no softer not thrusting itself on people s notice a bit the more for having been outdone by louder sounds tink tink tink tink tink It was a perfect embodiment of the still small voice free from all cold hoarseness huskiness or unhealthiness of any kind foot passengers slackened their pace and were disposed to linger near it neighbours who had got up splenetic that morning felt good humour stealing on them as they heard it and by degrees became quite sprightly mothers danced their babies to its ringing still the same magical tink tink tink came gaily from the workshop of the Golden Key Who but the locksmith could have made such music A gleam of sun shining through the unsashed window and chequering the dark workshop with a broad patch of light fell full upon him as though attracted by his sunny heart There he stood working at his anvil his face all radiant with exercise and gladness his sleeves turned up his wig pushed off his shining forehead the easiest freest happiest man in all the world Beside him sat a sleek cat purring and winking in the light and falling every now and then into an idle doze as from excess of comfort Toby looked on from a tall bench hard by one beaming smile from his broad nut brown face down to the slack baked buckles in his shoes The very locks that hung around had something jovial in their rust and seemed like gouty gentlemen of hearty natures disposed to joke on their infirmities There was nothing surly or severe in the whole scene It seemed impossible that any one of the innumerable keys could fit a churlish strong box or a prison door Cellars of beer and wine rooms where there were fires books gossip and cheering laughter these were their proper sphere of action Places of distrust and cruelty and restraint they would have left quadruple locked for ever Tink tink tink The locksmith paused at last and wiped his brow The silence roused the cat who jumping softly down crept to the door and watched with tiger eyes a bird cage in an opposite window Gabriel lifted Toby to his mouth and took a hearty draught Then as he stood upright with his head flung back and his portly chest thrown out you would have seen that Gabriel s lower man was clothed in military gear Glancing at the wall beyond there might have been espied hanging on their several pegs a cap and feather broadsword sash and coat of scarlet which any man learned in such matters would have known from their make and pattern to be the uniform of a serjeant in the Royal East London Volunteers As the locksmith put his mug down empty on the bench whence it had smiled on him before he glanced at these articles with a laughing eye and looking at them with his head a little on one side as though he would get them all into a focus said leaning on his hammer Time was now I remember when I was like to run mad with the desire to wear a coat of that colour If any one except my father had called me a fool for my pains how I should have fired and fumed But what a fool I must have been sure ly Ah sighed Mrs Varden who had entered unobserved A fool indeed A man at your time of life Varden should know better now Why what a ridiculous woman you are Martha said the locksmith turning round with a smile Certainly replied Mrs V with great demureness Of course I am I know that Varden Thank you I mean began the locksmith Yes said his wife I know what you mean You speak quite plain enough to be understood Varden It s very kind of you to adapt yourself to my capacity I am sure Tut tut Martha rejoined the locksmith don t take offence at nothing I mean how strange it is of you to run down volunteering when it s done to defend you and all the other women and our own fireside and everybody else s in case of need It s unchristian cried Mrs Varden shaking her head Unchristian said the locksmith Why what the devil Mrs Varden looked at the ceiling as in expectation that the consequence of this profanity would be the immediate descent of the four post bedstead on the second floor together with the best sitting room on the first but no visible judgment occurring she heaved a deep sigh and begged her husband in a tone of resignation to go on and by all means to blaspheme as much as possible because he knew she liked it The locksmith did for a moment seem disposed to gratify her but he gave a great gulp and mildly rejoined I was going to say what on earth do you call it unchristian for Which would be most unchristian Martha to sit quietly down and let our houses be sacked by a foreign army or to turn out like men and drive em off Shouldn t I be a nice sort of a Christian if I crept into a corner of my own chimney and looked on while a parcel of whiskered savages bore off Dolly or you When he said or you Mrs Varden despite herself relaxed into a smile There was something complimentary in the idea In such a state of things as that indeed she simpered As that repeated the locksmith Well that would be the state of things directly Even Miggs would go Some black tambourine player with a great turban on would be bearing HER off and unless the tambourine player was proof against kicking and scratching it s my belief he d have the worst of it Ha ha ha I d forgive the tambourine player I wouldn t have him interfered with on any account poor fellow And here the locksmith laughed again so heartily that tears came into his eyes much to Mrs Varden s indignation who thought the capture of so sound a Protestant and estimable a private character as Miggs by a pagan negro a circumstance too shocking and awful for contemplation The picture Gabriel had drawn indeed threatened serious consequences and would indubitably have led to them but luckily at that moment a light footstep crossed the threshold and Dolly running in threw her arms round her old father s neck and hugged him tight Here she is at last cried Gabriel And how well you look Doll and how late you are my darling How well she looked Well Why if he had exhausted every laudatory adjective in the dictionary it wouldn t have been praise enough When and where was there ever such a plump roguish comely bright eyed enticing bewitching captivating maddening little puss in all this world as Dolly What was the Dolly of five years ago to the Dolly of that day How many coachmakers saddlers cabinet makers and professors of other useful arts had deserted their fathers mothers sisters brothers and most of all their cousins for the love of her How many unknown gentlemen supposed to be of mighty fortunes if not titles had waited round the corner after dark and tempted Miggs the incorruptible with golden guineas to deliver offers of marriage folded up in love letters How many disconsolate fathers and substantial tradesmen had waited on the locksmith for the same purpose with dismal tales of how their sons had lost their appetites and taken to shut themselves up in dark bedrooms and wandering in desolate suburbs with pale faces and all because of Dolly Varden s loveliness and cruelty How many young men in all previous times of unprecedented steadiness had turned suddenly wild and wicked for the same reason and in an ecstasy of unrequited love taken to wrench off door knockers and invert the boxes of rheumatic watchmen How had she recruited the king s service both by sea and land through rendering desperate his loving subjects between the ages of eighteen and twenty five How many young ladies had publicly professed with tears in their eyes that for their tastes she was much too short too tall too bold too cold too stout too thin too fair too dark too everything but handsome How many old ladies taking counsel together had thanked Heaven their daughters were not like her and had hoped she might come to no harm and had thought she would come to no good and had wondered what people saw in her and had arrived at the conclusion that she was going off in her looks or had never come on in them and that she was a thorough imposition and a popular mistake And yet here was this same Dolly Varden so whimsical and hard to please that she was Dolly Varden still all smiles and dimples and pleasant looks and caring no more for the fifty or sixty young fellows who at that very moment were breaking their hearts to marry her than if so many oysters had been crossed in love and opened afterwards Dolly hugged her father as has been already stated and having hugged her mother also accompanied both into the little parlour where the cloth was already laid for dinner and where Miss Miggs a trifle more rigid and bony than of yore received her with a sort of hysterical gasp intended for a smile Into the hands of that young virgin she delivered her bonnet and walking dress all of a dreadful artful and designing kind and then said with a laugh which rivalled the locksmith s music How glad I always am to be at home again And how glad we always are Doll said her father putting back the dark hair from her sparkling eyes to have you at home Give me a kiss If there had been anybody of the male kind there to see her do it but there was not it was a mercy I don t like your being at the Warren said the locksmith I can t bear to have you out of my sight And what is the news over yonder Doll What news there is I think you know already replied his daughter I am sure you do though Ay cried the locksmith What s that Come come said Dolly you know very well I want you to tell me why Mr Haredale oh how gruff he is again to be sure has been away from home for some days past and why he is travelling about we know he IS travelling because of his letters without telling his own niece why or wherefore Miss Emma doesn t want to know I ll swear returned the locksmith I don t know that said Dolly but I do at any rate Do tell me Why is he so secret and what is this ghost story which nobody is to tell Miss Emma and which seems to be mixed up with his going away Now I see you know by your colouring so What the story means or is or has to do with it I know no more than you my dear returned the locksmith except that it s some foolish fear of little Solomon s which has indeed no meaning in it I suppose As to Mr Haredale s journey he goes as I believe Yes said Dolly As I believe resumed the locksmith pinching her cheek on business Doll What it may be is quite another matter Read Blue Beard and don t be too curious pet it s no business of yours or mine depend upon that and here s dinner which is much more to the purpose Dolly might have remonstrated against this summary dismissal of the subject notwithstanding the appearance of dinner but at the mention of Blue Beard Mrs Varden interposed protesting she could not find it in her conscience to sit tamely by and hear her child recommended to peruse the adventures of a Turk and Mussulman far less of a fabulous Turk which she considered that potentate to be She held that in such stirring and tremendous times as those in which they lived it would be much more to the purpose if Dolly became a regular subscriber to the Thunderer where she would have an opportunity of reading Lord George Gordon s speeches word for word which would be a greater comfort and solace to her than a hundred and fifty Blue Beards ever could impart She appealed in support of this proposition to Miss Miggs then in waiting who said that indeed the peace of mind she had derived from the perusal of that paper generally but especially of one article of the very last week as ever was entitled Great Britain drenched in gore exceeded all belief the same composition she added had also wrought such a comforting effect on the mind of a married sister of hers then resident at Golden Lion Court number twenty sivin second bell handle on the right hand door post that being in a delicate state of health and in fact expecting an addition to her family she had been seized with fits directly after its perusal and had raved of the Inquisition ever since to the great improvement of her husband and friends Miss Miggs went on to say that she would recommend all those whose hearts were hardened to hear Lord George themselves whom she commended first in respect of his steady Protestantism then of his oratory then of his eyes then of his nose then of his legs and lastly of his figure generally which she looked upon as fit for any statue prince or angel to which sentiment Mrs Varden fully subscribed Mrs Varden having cut in looked at a box upon the mantelshelf painted in imitation of a very red brick dwelling house with a yellow roof having at top a real chimney down which voluntary subscribers dropped their silver gold or pence into the parlour and on the door the counterfeit presentment of a brass plate whereon was legibly inscribed Protestant Association and looking at it said that it was to her a source of poignant misery to think that Varden never had of all his substance dropped anything into that temple save once in secret as she afterwards discovered two fragments of tobacco pipe which she hoped would not be put down to his last account That Dolly she was grieved to say was no less backward in her contributions better loving as it seemed to purchase ribbons and such gauds than to encourage the great cause then in such heavy tribulation and that she did entreat her her father she much feared could not be moved not to despise but imitate the bright example of Miss Miggs who flung her wages as it were into the very countenance of the Pope and bruised his features with her quarter s money Oh mim said Miggs don t relude to that I had no intentions mim that nobody should know Such sacrifices as I can make are quite a widder s mite It s all I have cried Miggs with a great burst of tears for with her they never came on by degrees but it s made up to me in other ways it s well made up This was quite true though not perhaps in the sense that Miggs intended As she never failed to keep her self denial full in Mrs Varden s view it drew forth so many gifts of caps and gowns and other articles of dress that upon the whole the red brick house was perhaps the best investment for her small capital she could possibly have hit upon returning her interest at the rate of seven or eight per cent in money and fifty at least in personal repute and credit You needn t cry Miggs said Mrs Varden herself in tears you needn t be ashamed of it though your poor mistress IS on the same side Miggs howled at this remark in a peculiarly dismal way and said she knowed that master hated her That it was a dreadful thing to live in families and have dislikes and not give satisfactions That to make divisions was a thing she could not abear to think of neither could her feelings let her do it That if it was master s wishes as she and him should part it was best they should part and she hoped he might be the happier for it and always wished him well and that he might find somebody as would meet his dispositions It would be a hard trial she said to part from such a missis but she could meet any suffering when her conscience told her she was in the rights and therefore she was willing even to go that lengths She did not think she added that she could long survive the separations but as she was hated and looked upon unpleasant perhaps her dying as soon as possible would be the best endings for all parties With this affecting conclusion Miss Miggs shed more tears and sobbed abundantly Can you bear this Varden said his wife in a solemn voice laying down her knife and fork Why not very well my dear rejoined the locksmith but I try to keep my temper Don t let there be words on my account mim sobbed Miggs It s much the best that we should part I wouldn t stay oh gracious me and make dissensions not for a annual gold mine and found in tea and sugar Lest the reader should be at any loss to discover the cause of Miss Miggs s deep emotion it may be whispered apart that happening to be listening as her custom sometimes was when Gabriel and his wife conversed together she had heard the locksmith s joke relative to the foreign black who played the tambourine and bursting with the spiteful feelings which the taunt awoke in her fair breast exploded in the manner we have witnessed Matters having now arrived at a crisis the locksmith as usual and for the sake of peace and quietness gave in What are you crying for girl he said What s the matter with you What are you talking about hatred for I don t hate you I don t hate anybody Dry your eyes and make yourself agreeable in Heaven s name and let us all be happy while we can The allied powers deeming it good generalship to consider this a sufficient apology on the part of the enemy and confession of having been in the wrong did dry their eyes and take it in good part Miss Miggs observed that she bore no malice no not to her greatest foe whom she rather loved the more indeed the greater persecution she sustained Mrs Varden approved of this meek and forgiving spirit in high terms and incidentally declared as a closing article of agreement that Dolly should accompany her to the Clerkenwell branch of the association that very night This was an extraordinary instance of her great prudence and policy having had this end in view from the first and entertaining a secret misgiving that the locksmith who was bold when Dolly was in question would object she had backed Miss Miggs up to this point in order that she might have him at a disadvantage The manoeuvre succeeded so well that Gabriel only made a wry face and with the warning he had just had fresh in his mind did not dare to say one word The difference ended therefore in Miggs being presented with a gown by Mrs Varden and half a crown by Dolly as if she had eminently distinguished herself in the paths of morality and goodness Mrs V according to custom expressed her hope that Varden would take a lesson from what had passed and learn more generous conduct for the time to come and the dinner being now cold and nobody s appetite very much improved by what had passed they went on with it as Mrs Varden said like Christians As there was to be a grand parade of the Royal East London Volunteers that afternoon the locksmith did no more work but sat down comfortably with his pipe in his mouth and his arm round his pretty daughter s waist looking lovingly on Mrs V from time to time and exhibiting from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot one smiling surface of good humour And to be sure when it was time to dress him in his regimentals and Dolly hanging about him in all kinds of graceful winning ways helped to button and buckle and brush him up and get him into one of the tightest coats that ever was made by mortal tailor he was the proudest father in all England What a handy jade it is said the locksmith to Mrs Varden who stood by with folded hands rather proud of her husband too while Miggs held his cap and sword at arm s length as if mistrusting that the latter might run some one through the body of its own accord but never marry a soldier Doll my dear Dolly didn t ask why not or say a word indeed but stooped her head down very low to tie his sash I never wear this dress said honest Gabriel but I think of poor Joe Willet I loved Joe he was always a favourite of mine Poor Joe Dear heart my girl don t tie me in so tight Dolly laughed not like herself at all the strangest little laugh that could be and held her head down lower still Poor Joe resumed the locksmith muttering to himself I always wish he had come to me I might have made it up between them if he had Ah old John made a great mistake in his way of acting by that lad a great mistake Have you nearly tied that sash my dear What an ill made sash it was There it was loose again and trailing on the ground Dolly was obliged to kneel down and recommence at the beginning Never mind young Willet Varden said his wife frowning you might find some one more deserving to talk about I think Miss Miggs gave a great sniff to the same effect Nay Martha cried the locksmith don t let us bear too hard upon him If the lad is dead indeed we ll deal kindly by his memory A runaway and a vagabond said Mrs Varden Miss Miggs expressed her concurrence as before A runaway my dear but not a vagabond returned the locksmith in a gentle tone He behaved himself well did Joe always and was a handsome manly fellow Don t call him a vagabond Martha Mrs Varden coughed and so did Miggs He tried hard to gain your good opinion Martha I can tell you said the locksmith smiling and stroking his chin Ah that he did It seems but yesterday that he followed me out to the Maypole door one night and begged me not to say how like a boy they used him say here at home he meant though at the time I recollect I didn t understand And how s Miss Dolly sir says Joe pursued the locksmith musing sorrowfully Ah Poor Joe Well I declare cried Miggs Oh Goodness gracious me What s the matter now said Gabriel turning sharply to her Why if here an t Miss Dolly said the handmaid stooping down to look into her face a giving way to floods of tears Oh mim oh sir Raly it s give me such a turn cried the susceptible damsel pressing her hand upon her side to quell the palpitation of her heart that you might knock me down with a feather The locksmith after glancing at Miss Miggs as if he could have wished to have a feather brought straightway looked on with a broad stare while Dolly hurried away followed by that sympathising young woman then turning to his wife stammered out Is Dolly ill Have I done anything Is it my fault Your fault cried Mrs V reproachfully There you had better make haste out What have I done said poor Gabriel It was agreed that Mr Edward s name was never to be mentioned and I have not spoken of him have I Mrs Varden merely replied that she had no patience with him and bounced off after the other two The unfortunate locksmith wound his sash about him girded on his sword put on his cap and walked out I am not much of a dab at my exercise he said under his breath but I shall get into fewer scrapes at that work than at this Every man came into the world for something my department seems to be to make every woman cry without meaning it It s rather hard But he forgot it before he reached the end of the street and went on with a shining face nodding to the neighbours and showering about his friendly greetings like mild spring rain Chapter 42 The Royal East London Volunteers made a brilliant sight that day formed into lines squares circles triangles and what not to the beating of drums and the streaming of flags and performed a vast number of complex evolutions in all of which Serjeant Varden bore a conspicuous share Having displayed their military prowess to the utmost in these warlike shows they marched in glittering order to the Chelsea Bun House and regaled in the adjacent taverns until dark Then at sound of drum they fell in again and returned amidst the shouting of His Majesty s lieges to the place from whence they came The homeward march being somewhat tardy owing to the un soldierlike behaviour of certain corporals who being gentlemen of sedentary pursuits in private life and excitable out of doors broke several windows with their bayonets and rendered it imperative on the commanding officer to deliver them over to a strong guard with whom they fought at intervals as they came along it was nine o clock when the locksmith reached home A hackney coach was waiting near his door and as he passed it Mr Haredale looked from the window and called him by his name The sight of you is good for sore eyes sir said the locksmith stepping up to him I wish you had walked in though rather than waited here There is nobody at home I find Mr Haredale answered besides I desired to be as private as I could Humph muttered the locksmith looking round at his house Gone with Simon Tappertit to that precious Branch no doubt Mr Haredale invited him to come into the coach and if he were not tired or anxious to go home to ride with him a little way that they might have some talk together Gabriel cheerfully complied and the coachman mounting his box drove off Varden said Mr Haredale after a minute s pause you will be amazed to hear what errand I am on it will seem a very strange one I have no doubt it s a reasonable one sir and has a meaning in it replied the locksmith or it would not be yours at all Have you just come back to town sir But half an hour ago Bringing no news of Barnaby or his mother said the locksmith dubiously Ah you needn t shake your head sir It was a wild goose chase I feared that from the first You exhausted all reasonable means of discovery when they went away To begin again after so long a time has passed is hopeless sir quite hopeless Why where are they he returned impatiently Where can they be Above ground God knows rejoined the locksmith many that I knew above it five years ago have their beds under the grass now And the world is a wide place It s a hopeless attempt sir believe me We must leave the discovery of this mystery like all others to time and accident and Heaven s pleasure Varden my good fellow said Mr Haredale I have a deeper meaning in my present anxiety to find them out than you can fathom It is not a mere whim it is not the casual revival of my old wishes and desires but an earnest solemn purpose My thoughts and dreams all tend to it and fix it in my mind I have no rest by day or night I have no peace or quiet I am haunted His voice was so altered from its usual tones and his manner bespoke so much emotion that Gabriel in his wonder could only sit and look towards him in the darkness and fancy the expression of his face Do not ask me continued Mr Haredale to explain myself If I were to do so you would think me the victim of some hideous fancy It is enough that this is so and that I cannot no I can not lie quietly in my bed without doing what will seem to you incomprehensible Since when sir said the locksmith after a pause has this uneasy feeling been upon you Mr Haredale hesitated for some moments and then replied Since the night of the storm In short since the last nineteenth of March As though he feared that Varden might express surprise or reason with him he hastily went on You will think I know I labour under some delusion Perhaps I do But it is not a morbid one it is a wholesome action of the mind reasoning on actual occurrences You know the furniture remains in Mrs Rudge s house and that it has been shut up by my orders since she went away save once a week or so when an old neighbour visits it to scare away the rats I am on my way there now For what purpose asked the locksmith To pass the night there he replied and not to night alone but many nights This is a secret which I trust to you in case of any unexpected emergency You will not come unless in case of strong necessity to me from dusk to broad day I shall be there Emma your daughter and the rest suppose me out of London as I have been until within this hour Do not undeceive them This is the errand I am bound upon I know I may confide it to you and I rely upon your questioning me no more at this time With that as if to change the theme he led the astounded locksmith back to the night of the Maypole highwayman to the robbery of Edward Chester to the reappearance of the man at Mrs Rudge s house and to all the strange circumstances which afterwards occurred He even asked him carelessly about the man s height his face his figure whether he was like any one he had ever seen like Hugh for instance or any man he had known at any time and put many questions of that sort which the locksmith considering them as mere devices to engage his attention and prevent his expressing the astonishment he felt answered pretty much at random At length they arrived at the corner of the street in which the house stood where Mr Haredale alighting dismissed the coach If you desire to see me safely lodged he said turning to the locksmith with a gloomy smile you can Gabriel to whom all former marvels had been nothing in comparison with this followed him along the narrow pavement in silence When they reached the door Mr Haredale softly opened it with a key he had about him and closing it when Varden entered they were left in thorough darkness They groped their way into the ground floor room Here Mr Haredale struck a light and kindled a pocket taper he had brought with him for the purpose It was then when the flame was full upon him that the locksmith saw for the first time how haggard pale and changed he looked how worn and thin he was how perfectly his whole appearance coincided with all that he had said so strangely as they rode along It was not an unnatural impulse in Gabriel after what he had heard to note curiously the expression of his eyes It was perfectly collected and rational so much so indeed that he felt ashamed of his momentary suspicion and drooped his own when Mr Haredale looked towards him as if he feared they would betray his thoughts Will you walk through the house said Mr Haredale with a glance towards the window the crazy shutters of which were closed and fastened Speak low There was a kind of awe about the place which would have rendered it difficult to speak in any other manner Gabriel whispered Yes and followed him upstairs Everything was just as they had seen it last There was a sense of closeness from the exclusion of fresh air and a gloom and heaviness around as though long imprisonment had made the very silence sad The homely hangings of the beds and windows had begun to droop the dust lay thick upon their dwindling folds and damps had made their way through ceiling wall and floor The boards creaked beneath their tread as if resenting the unaccustomed intrusion nimble spiders paralysed by the taper s glare checked the motion of their hundred legs upon the wall or dropped like lifeless things upon the ground the death watch ticked and the scampering feet of rats and mice rattled behind the wainscot As they looked about them on the decaying furniture it was strange to find how vividly it presented those to whom it had belonged and with whom it was once familiar Grip seemed to perch again upon his high backed chair Barnaby to crouch in his old favourite corner by the fire the mother to resume her usual seat and watch him as of old Even when they could separate these objects from the phantoms of the mind which they invoked the latter only glided out of sight but lingered near them still for then they seemed to lurk in closets and behind the doors ready to start out and suddenly accost them in well remembered tones They went downstairs and again into the room they had just now left Mr Haredale unbuckled his sword and laid it on the table with a pair of pocket pistols then told the locksmith he would light him to the door But this is a dull place sir said Gabriel lingering may no one share your watch He shook his head and so plainly evinced his wish to be alone that Gabriel could say no more In another moment the locksmith was standing in the street whence he could see that the light once more travelled upstairs and soon returning to the room below shone brightly through the chinks of the shutters If ever man were sorely puzzled and perplexed the locksmith was that night Even when snugly seated by his own fireside with Mrs Varden opposite in a nightcap and night jacket and Dolly beside him in a most distracting dishabille curling her hair and smiling as if she had never cried in all her life and never could even then with Toby at his elbow and his pipe in his mouth and Miggs but that perhaps was not much falling asleep in the background he could not quite discard his wonder and uneasiness So in his dreams still there was Mr Haredale haggard and careworn listening in the solitary house to every sound that stirred with the taper shining through the chinks until the day should turn it pale and end his lonely watching Chapter 43 Next morning brought no satisfaction to the locksmith s thoughts nor next day nor the next nor many others Often after nightfall he entered the street and turned his eyes towards the well known house and as surely as he did so there was the solitary light still gleaming through the crevices of the window shutter while all within was motionless noiseless cheerless as a grave Unwilling to hazard Mr Haredale s favour by disobeying his strict injunction he never ventured to knock at the door or to make his presence known in any way But whenever strong interest and curiosity attracted him to the spot which was not seldom the light was always there If he could have known what passed within the knowledge would have yielded him no clue to this mysterious vigil At twilight Mr Haredale shut himself up and at daybreak he came forth He never missed a night always came and went alone and never varied his proceedings in the least degree The manner of his watch was this At dusk he entered the house in the same way as when the locksmith bore him company kindled a light went through the rooms and narrowly examined them That done he returned to the chamber on the ground floor and laying his sword and pistols on the table sat by it until morning He usually had a book with him and often tried to read but never fixed his eyes or thoughts upon it for five minutes together The slightest noise without doors caught his ear a step upon the pavement seemed to make his heart leap He was not without some refreshment during the long lonely hours generally carrying in his pocket a sandwich of bread and meat and a small flask of wine The latter diluted with large quantities of water he drank in a heated feverish way as though his throat were dried but he scarcely ever broke his fast by so much as a crumb of bread If this voluntary sacrifice of sleep and comfort had its origin as the locksmith on consideration was disposed to think in any superstitious expectation of the fulfilment of a dream or vision connected with the event on which he had brooded for so many years and if he waited for some ghostly visitor who walked abroad when men lay sleeping in their beds he showed no trace of fear or wavering His stern features expressed inflexible resolution his brows were puckered and his lips compressed with deep and settled purpose and when he started at a noise and listened it was not with the start of fear but hope and catching up his sword as though the hour had come at last he would clutch it in his tight clenched hand and listen with sparkling eyes and eager looks until it died away These disappointments were numerous for they ensued on almost every sound but his constancy was not shaken Still every night he was at his post the same stern sleepless sentinel and still night passed and morning dawned and he must watch again This went on for weeks he had taken a lodging at Vauxhall in which to pass the day and rest himself and from this place when the tide served he usually came to London Bridge from Westminster by water in order that he might avoid the busy streets One evening shortly before twilight he came his accustomed road upon the river s bank intending to pass through Westminster Hall into Palace Yard and there take boat to London Bridge as usual There was a pretty large concourse of people assembled round the Houses of Parliament looking at the members as they entered and departed and giving vent to rather noisy demonstrations of approval or dislike according to their known opinions As he made his way among the throng he heard once or twice the No Popery cry which was then becoming pretty familiar to the ears of most men but holding it in very slight regard and observing that the idlers were of the lowest grade he neither thought nor cared about it but made his way along with perfect indifference There were many little knots and groups of persons in Westminster Hall some few looking upward at its noble ceiling and at the rays of evening light tinted by the setting sun which streamed in aslant through its small windows and growing dimmer by degrees were quenched in the gathering gloom below some noisy passengers mechanics going home from work and otherwise who hurried quickly through waking the echoes with their voices and soon darkening the small door in the distance as they passed into the street beyond some in busy conference together on political or private matters pacing slowly up and down with eyes that sought the ground and seeming by their attitudes to listen earnestly from head to foot Here a dozen squabbling urchins made a very Babel in the air there a solitary man half clerk half mendicant paced up and down with hungry dejection in his look and gait at his elbow passed an errand lad swinging his basket round and round and with his shrill whistle riving the very timbers of the roof while a more observant schoolboy half way through pocketed his ball and eyed the distant beadle as he came looming on It was that time of evening when if you shut your eyes and open them again the darkness of an hour appears to have gathered in a second The smooth worn pavement dusty with footsteps still called upon the lofty walls to reiterate the shuffle and the tread of feet unceasingly save when the closing of some heavy door resounded through the building like a clap of thunder and drowned all other noises in its rolling sound Mr Haredale glancing only at such of these groups as he passed nearest to and then in a manner betokening that his thoughts were elsewhere had nearly traversed the Hall when two persons before him caught his attention One of these a gentleman in elegant attire carried in his hand a cane which he twirled in a jaunty manner as he loitered on the other an obsequious crouching fawning figure listened to what he said at times throwing in a humble word himself and with his shoulders shrugged up to his ears rubbed his hands submissively or answered at intervals by an inclination of the head half way between a nod of acquiescence and a bow of most profound respect In the abstract there was nothing very remarkable in this pair for servility waiting on a handsome suit of clothes and a cane not to speak of gold and silver sticks or wands of office is common enough But there was that about the well dressed man yes and about the other likewise which struck Mr Haredale with no pleasant feeling He hesitated stopped and would have stepped aside and turned out of his path but at the moment the other two faced about quickly and stumbled upon him before he could avoid them The gentleman with the cane lifted his hat and had begun to tender an apology which Mr Haredale had begun as hastily to acknowledge and walk away when he stopped short and cried Haredale Gad bless me this is strange indeed It is he returned impatiently yes a My dear friend cried the other detaining him why such great speed One minute Haredale for the sake of old acquaintance I am in haste he said Neither of us has sought this meeting Let it be a brief one Good night Fie fie replied Sir John for it was he how very churlish We were speaking of you Your name was on my lips perhaps you heard me mention it No I am sorry for that I am really sorry You know our friend here Haredale This is really a most remarkable meeting The friend plainly very ill at ease had made bold to press Sir John s arm and to give him other significant hints that he was desirous of avoiding this introduction As it did not suit Sir John s purpose however that it should be evaded he appeared quite unconscious of these silent remonstrances and inclined his hand towards him as he spoke to call attention to him more particularly The friend therefore had nothing for it but to muster up the pleasantest smile he could and to make a conciliatory bow as Mr Haredale turned his eyes upon him Seeing that he was recognised he put out his hand in an awkward and embarrassed manner which was not mended by its contemptuous rejection Mr Gashford said Haredale coldly It is as I have heard then You have left the darkness for the light sir and hate those whose opinions you formerly held with all the bitterness of a renegade You are an honour sir to any cause I wish the one you espouse at present much joy of the acquisition it has made The secretary rubbed his hands and bowed as though he would disarm his adversary by humbling himself before him Sir John Chester again exclaimed with an air of great gaiety Now really this is a most remarkable meeting and took a pinch of snuff with his usual self possession Mr Haredale said Gashford stealthily raising his eyes and letting them drop again when they met the other s steady gaze is too conscientious too honourable too manly I am sure to attach unworthy motives to an honest change of opinions even though it implies a doubt of those he holds himself Mr Haredale is too just too generous too clear sighted in his moral vision to Yes sir he rejoined with a sarcastic smile finding the secretary stopped You were saying Gashford meekly shrugged his shoulders and looking on the ground again was silent No but let us really interposed Sir John at this juncture let us really for a moment contemplate the very remarkable character of this meeting Haredale my dear friend pardon me if I think you are not sufficiently impressed with its singularity Here we stand by no previous appointment or arrangement three old schoolfellows in Westminster Hall three old boarders in a remarkably dull and shady seminary at Saint Omer s where you being Catholics and of necessity educated out of England were brought up and where I being a promising young Protestant at that time was sent to learn the French tongue from a native of Paris Add to the singularity Sir John said Mr Haredale that some of you Protestants of promise are at this moment leagued in yonder building to prevent our having the surpassing and unheard of privilege of teaching our children to read and write here in this land where thousands of us enter your service every year and to preserve the freedom of which we die in bloody battles abroad in heaps and that others of you to the number of some thousands as I learn are led on to look on all men of my creed as wolves and beasts of prey by this man Gashford Add to it besides the bare fact that this man lives in society walks the streets in broad day I was about to say holds up his head but that he does not and it will be strange and very strange I grant you Oh you are hard upon our friend replied Sir John with an engaging smile You are really very hard upon our friend Let him go on Sir John said Gashford fumbling with his gloves Let him go on I can make allowances Sir John I am honoured with your good opinion and I can dispense with Mr Haredale s Mr Haredale is a sufferer from the penal laws and I can t expect his favour You have so much of my favour sir retorted Mr Haredale with a bitter glance at the third party in their conversation that I am glad to see you in such good company You are the essence of your great Association in yourselves Now there you mistake said Sir John in his most benignant way There which is a most remarkable circumstance for a man of your punctuality and exactness Haredale you fall into error I don t belong to the body I have an immense respect for its members but I don t belong to it although I am it is certainly true the conscientious opponent of your being relieved I feel it my duty to be so it is a most unfortunate necessity and cost me a bitter struggle Will you try this box If you don t object to a trifling infusion of a very chaste scent you ll find its flavour exquisite I ask your pardon Sir John said Mr Haredale declining the proffer with a motion of his hand for having ranked you among the humble instruments who are obvious and in all men s sight I should have done more justice to your genius Men of your capacity plot in secrecy and safety and leave exposed posts to the duller wits Don t apologise for the world replied Sir John sweetly old friends like you and I may be allowed some freedoms or the deuce is in it Gashford who had been very restless all this time but had not once looked up now turned to Sir John and ventured to mutter something to the effect that he must go or my lord would perhaps be waiting Don t distress yourself good sir said Mr Haredale I ll take my leave and put you at your ease which he was about to do without ceremony when he was stayed by a buzz and murmur at the upper end of the hall and looking in that direction saw Lord George Gordon coming in with a crowd of people round him There was a lurking look of triumph though very differently expressed in the faces of his two companions which made it a natural impulse on Mr Haredale s part not to give way before this leader but to stand there while he passed He drew himself up and clasping his hands behind him looked on with a proud and scornful aspect while Lord George slowly advanced for the press was great about him towards the spot where they were standing He had left the House of Commons but that moment and had come straight down into the Hall bringing with him as his custom was intelligence of what had been said that night in reference to the Papists and what petitions had been presented in their favour and who had supported them and when the bill was to be brought in and when it would be advisable to present their own Great Protestant petition All this he told the persons about him in a loud voice and with great abundance of ungainly gesture Those who were nearest him made comments to each other and vented threats and murmurings those who were outside the crowd cried Silence and Stand back or closed in upon the rest endeavouring to make a forcible exchange of places and so they came driving on in a very disorderly and irregular way as it is the manner of a crowd to do When they were very near to where the secretary Sir John and Mr Haredale stood Lord George turned round and making a few remarks of a sufliciently violent and incoherent kind concluded with the usual sentiment and called for three cheers to back it While these were in the act of being given with great energy he extricated himself from the press and stepped up to Gashford s side Both he and Sir John being well known to the populace they fell back a little and left the four standing together Mr Haredale Lord George said Sir John Chester seeing that the nobleman regarded him with an inquisitive look A Catholic gentleman unfortunately most unhappily a Catholic but an esteemed acquaintance of mine and once of Mr Gashford s My dear Haredale this is Lord George Gordon I should have known that had I been ignorant of his lordship s person said Mr Haredale I hope there is but one gentleman in England who addressing an ignorant and excited throng would speak of a large body of his fellow subjects in such injurious language as I heard this moment For shame my lord for shame I cannot talk to you sir replied Lord George in a loud voice and waving his hand in a disturbed and agitated manner we have nothing in common We have much in common many things all that the Almighty gave us said Mr Haredale and common charity not to say common sense and common decency should teach you to refrain from these proceedings If every one of those men had arms in their hands at this moment as they have them in their heads I would not leave this place without telling you that you disgrace your station I don t hear you sir he replied in the same manner as before I can t hear you It is indifferent to me what you say Don t retort Gashford for the secretary had made a show of wishing to do so I can hold no communion with the worshippers of idols As he said this he glanced at Sir John who lifted his hands and eyebrows as if deploring the intemperate conduct of Mr Haredale and smiled in admiration of the crowd and of their leader HE retort cried Haredale Look you here my lord Do you know this man Lord George replied by laying his hand upon the shoulder of his cringing secretary and viewing him with a smile of confidence This man said Mr Haredale eyeing him from top to toe who in his boyhood was a thief and has been from that time to this a servile false and truckling knave this man who has crawled and crept through life wounding the hands he licked and biting those he fawned upon this sycophant who never knew what honour truth or courage meant who robbed his benefactor s daughter of her virtue and married her to break her heart and did it with stripes and cruelty this creature who has whined at kitchen windows for the broken food and begged for halfpence at our chapel doors this apostle of the faith whose tender conscience cannot bear the altars where his vicious life was publicly denounced Do you know this man Oh really you are very very hard upon our friend exclaimed Sir John Let Mr Haredale go on said Gashford upon whose unwholesome face the perspiration had broken out during this speech in blotches of wet I don t mind him Sir John it s quite as indifferent to me what he says as it is to my lord If he reviles my lord as you have heard Sir John how can I hope to escape Is it not enough my lord Mr Haredale continued that I as good a gentleman as you must hold my property such as it is by a trick at which the state connives because of these hard laws and that we may not teach our youth in schools the common principles of right and wrong but must we be denounced and ridden by such men as this Here is a man to head your No Popery cry For shame For shame The infatuated nobleman had glanced more than once at Sir John Chester as if to inquire whether there was any truth in these statements concerning Gashford and Sir John had as often plainly answered by a shrug or look Oh dear me no He now said in the same loud key and in the same strange manner as before I have nothing to say sir in reply and no desire to hear anything more I beg you won t obtrude your conversation or these personal attacks upon me I shall not be deterred from doing my duty to my country and my countrymen by any such attempts whether they proceed from emissaries of the Pope or not I assure you Come Gashford They had walked on a few paces while speaking and were now at the Hall door through which they passed together Mr Haredale without any leave taking turned away to the river stairs which were close at hand and hailed the only boatman who remained there But the throng of people the foremost of whom had heard every word that Lord George Gordon said and among all of whom the rumour had been rapidly dispersed that the stranger was a Papist who was bearding him for his advocacy of the popular cause came pouring out pell mell and forcing the nobleman his secretary and Sir John Chester on before them so that they appeared to be at their head crowded to the top of the stairs where Mr Haredale waited until the boat was ready and there stood still leaving him on a little clear space by himself They were not silent however though inactive At first some indistinct mutterings arose among them which were followed by a hiss or two and these swelled by degrees into a perfect storm Then one voice said Down with the Papists and there was a pretty general cheer but nothing more After a lull of a few moments one man cried out Stone him another Duck him another in a stentorian voice No Popery This favourite cry the rest re echoed and the mob which might have been two hundred strong joined in a general shout Mr Haredale had stood calmly on the brink of the steps until they made this demonstration when he looked round contemptuously and walked at a slow pace down the stairs He was pretty near the boat when Gashford as if without intention turned about and directly afterwards a great stone was thrown by some hand in the crowd which struck him on the head and made him stagger like a drunken man The blood sprung freely from the wound and trickled down his coat He turned directly and rushing up the steps with a boldness and passion which made them all fall back demanded Who did that Show me the man who hit me Not a soul moved except some in the rear who slunk off and escaping to the other side of the way looked on like indifferent spectators Who did that he repeated Show me the man who did it Dog was it you It was your deed if not your hand I know you He threw himself on Gashford as he said the words and hurled him to the ground There was a sudden motion in the crowd and some laid hands upon him but his sword was out and they fell off again My lord Sir John he cried draw one of you you are responsible for this outrage and I look to you Draw if you are gentlemen With that he struck Sir John upon the breast with the flat of his weapon and with a burning face and flashing eyes stood upon his guard alone before them all For an instant for the briefest space of time the mind can readily conceive there was a change in Sir John s smooth face such as no man ever saw there The next moment he stepped forward and laid one hand on Mr Haredale s arm while with the other he endeavoured to appease the crowd My dear friend my good Haredale you are blinded with passion it s very natural extremely natural but you don t know friends from foes I know them all sir I can distinguish well he retorted almost mad with rage Sir John Lord George do you hear me Are you cowards Never mind sir said a man forcing his way between and pushing him towards the stairs with friendly violence never mind asking that For God s sake get away What CAN you do against this number And there are as many more in the next street who ll be round dfrectly indeed they began to pour in as he said the words you d be giddy from that cut in the first heat of a scuffle Now do retire sir or take my word for it you ll be worse used than you would be if every man in the crowd was a woman and that woman Bloody Mary Come sir make haste as quick as you can Mr Haredale who began to turn faint and sick felt how sensible this advice was and descended the steps with his unknown friend s assistance John Grueby for John it was helped him into the boat and giving her a shove off which sent her thirty feet into the tide bade the waterman pull away like a Briton and walked up again as composedly as if he had just landed There was at first a slight disposition on the part of the mob to resent this interference but John looking particularly strong and cool and wearing besides Lord George s livery they thought better of it and contented themselves with sending a shower of small missiles after the boat which plashed harmlessly in the water for she had by this time cleared the bridge and was darting swiftly down the centre of the stream From this amusement they proceeded to giving Protestant knocks at the doors of private houses breaking a few lamps and assaulting some stray constables But it being whispered that a detachment of Life Guards had been sent for they took to their heels with great expedition and left the street quite clear Chapter 44 When the concourse separated and dividing into chance clusters drew off in various directions there still remained upon the scene of the late disturbance one man This man was Gashford who bruised by his late fall and hurt in a much greater degree by the indignity he had undergone and the exposure of which he had been the victim limped up and down breathing curses and threats of vengeance It was not the secretary s nature to waste his wrath in words While he vented the froth of his malevolence in those effusions he kept a steady eye on two men who having disappeared with the rest when the alarm was spread had since returned and were now visible in the moonlight at no great distance as they walked to and fro and talked together He made no move towards them but waited patiently on the dark side of the street until they were tired of strolling backwards and forwards and walked away in company Then he followed but at some distance keeping them in view without appearing to have that object or being seen by them They went up Parliament Street past Saint Martin s church and away by Saint Giles s to Tottenham Court Road at the back of which upon the western side was then a place called the Green Lanes This was a retired spot not of the choicest kind leading into the fields Great heaps of ashes stagnant pools overgrown with rank grass and duckweed broken turnstiles and the upright posts of palings long since carried off for firewood which menaced all heedless walkers with their jagged and rusty nails were the leading features of the landscape while here and there a donkey or a ragged horse tethered to a stake and cropping off a wretched meal from the coarse stunted turf were quite in keeping with the scene and would have suggested if the houses had not done so sufficiently of themselves how very poor the people were who lived in the crazy huts adjacent and how foolhardy it might prove for one who carried money or wore decent clothes to walk that way alone unless by daylight Poverty has its whims and shows of taste as wealth has Some of these cabins were turreted some had false windows painted on their rotten walls one had a mimic clock upon a crazy tower of four feet high which screened the chimney each in its little patch of ground had a rude seat or arbour The population dealt in bones in rags in broken glass in old wheels in birds and dogs These in their several ways of stowage filled the gardens and shedding a perfume not of the most delicious nature in the air filled it besides with yelps and screams and howling Into this retreat the secretary followed the two men whom he had held in sight and here he saw them safely lodged in one of the meanest houses which was but a room and that of small dimensions He waited without until the sound of their voices joined in a discordant song assured him they were making merry and then approaching the door by means of a tottering plank which crossed the ditch in front knocked at it with his hand Muster Gashfordl said the man who opened it taking his pipe from his mouth in evident surprise Why who d have thought of this here honour Walk in Muster Gashford walk in sir Gashford required no second invitation and entered with a gracious air There was a fire in the rusty grate for though the spring was pretty far advanced the nights were cold and on a stool beside it Hugh sat smoking Dennis placed a chair his only one for the secretary in front of the hearth and took his seat again upon the stool he had left when he rose to give the visitor admission What s in the wind now Muster Gashford he said as he resumed his pipe and looked at him askew Any orders from head quarters Are we going to begin What is it Muster Gashford Oh nothing nothing rejoined the secretary with a friendly nod to Hugh We have broken the ice though We had a little spurt to day eh Dennis A very little one growled the hangman Not half enough for me Nor me neither cried Hugh Give us something to do with life in it with life in it master Ha ha Why you wouldn t said the secretary with his worst expression of face and in his mildest tones have anything to do with with death in it I don t know that replied Hugh I m open to orders I don t care not I Nor I vociferated Dennis Brave fellows said the secretary in as pastor like a voice as if he were commending them for some uncommon act of valour and generosity By the bye and here he stopped and warmed his hands then suddenly looked up who threw that stone to day Mr Dennis coughed and shook his head as who should say A mystery indeed Hugh sat and smoked in silence It was well done said the secretary warming his hands again I should like to know that man Would you said Dennis after looking at his face to assure himself that he was serious Would you like to know that man Muster Gashford I should indeed replied the secretary Why then Lord love you said the hangman in his hoarest chuckle as he pointed with his pipe to Hugh there he sits That s the man My stars and halters Muster Gashford he added in a whisper as he drew his stool close to him and jogged him with his elbow what a interesting blade he is He wants as much holding in as a thorough bred bulldog If it hadn t been for me to day he d have had that ere Roman down and made a riot of it in another minute And why not cried Hugh in a surly voice as he overheard this last remark Where s the good of putting things off Strike while the iron s hot that s what I say Ah retorted Dennis shaking his head with a kind of pity for his friend s ingenuous youth but suppose the iron an t hot brother You must get people s blood up afore you strike and have em in the humour There wasn t quite enough to provoke em to day I tell you If you d had your way you d have spoilt the fun to come and ruined us Dennis is quite right said Gashford smoothly He is perfectly correct Dennis has great knowledge of the world I ought to have Muster Gashford seeing what a many people I ve helped out of it eh grinned the hangman whispering the words behind his hand The secretary laughed at this jest as much as Dennis could desire and when he had done said turning to Hugh Dennis s policy was mine as you may have observed You saw for instance how I fell when I was set upon I made no resistance I did nothing to provoke an outbreak Oh dear no No by the Lord Harry cried Dennis with a noisy laugh you went down very quiet Muster Gashford and very flat besides I thinks to myself at the time it s all up with Muster Gashford I never see a man lay flatter nor more still with the life in him than you did to day He s a rough un to play with is that ere Papist and that s the fact The secretary s face as Dennis roared with laughter and turned his wrinkled eyes on Hugh who did the like might have furnished a study for the devil s picture He sat quite silent until they were serious again and then said looking round We are very pleasant here so very pleasant Dennis that but for my lord s particular desire that I should sup with him and the time being very near at hand I should he inclined to stay until it would be hardly safe to go homeward I come upon a little business yes I do as you supposed It s very flattering to you being this If we ever should be obliged and we can t tell you know this is a very uncertain world I believe you Muster Gashford interposed the hangman with a grave nod The uncertainties as I ve seen in reference to this here state of existence the unexpected contingencies as have come about Oh my eye Feeling the subject much too vast for expression he puffed at his pipe again and looked the rest I say resumed the secretary in a slow impressive way we can t tell what may come to pass and if we should be obliged against our wills to have recourse to violence my lord who has suffered terribly to day as far as words can go consigns to you two bearing in mind my recommendation of you both as good staunch men beyond all doubt and suspicion the pleasant task of punishing this Haredale You may do as you please with him or his provided that you show no mercy and no quarter and leave no two beams of his house standing where the builder placed them You may sack it burn it do with it as you like but it must come down it must be razed to the ground and he and all belonging to him left as shelterless as new born infants whom their mothers have exposed Do you understand me said Gashford pausing and pressing his hands together gently Understand you master cried Hugh You speak plain now Why this is hearty I knew you would like it said Gashford shaking him by the hand I thought you would Good night Don t rise Dennis I would rather find my way alone I may have to make other visits here and it s pleasant to come and go without disturbing you I can find my way perfectly well Good night He was gone and had shut the door behind him They looked at each other and nodded approvingly Dennis stirred up the fire This looks a little more like business he said Ay indeed cried Hugh this suits me I ve heerd it said of Muster Gashford said the hangman that he d a surprising memory and wonderful firmness that he never forgot and never forgave Let s drink his health Hugh readily complied pouring no liquor on the floor when he drank this toast and they pledged the secretary as a man after their own hearts in a bumper Chapter 45 While the worst passions of the worst men were thus working in the dark and the mantle of religion assumed to cover the ugliest deformities threatened to become the shroud of all that was good and peaceful in society a circumstance occurred which once more altered the position of two persons from whom this history has long been separated and to whom it must now return In a small English country town the inhabitants of which supported themselves by the labour of their hands in plaiting and preparing straw for those who made bonnets and other articles of dress and ornament from that material concealed under an assumed name and living in a quiet poverty which knew no change no pleasures and few cares but that of struggling on from day to day in one great toil for bread dwelt Barnaby and his mother Their poor cottage had known no stranger s foot since they sought the shelter of its roof five years before nor had they in all that time held any commerce or communication with the old world from which they had fled To labour in peace and devote her labour and her life to her poor son was all the widow sought If happiness can be said at any time to be the lot of one on whom a secret sorrow preys she was happy now Tranquillity resignation and her strong love of him who needed it so much formed the small circle of her quiet joys and while that remained unbroken she was contented For Barnaby himself the time which had flown by had passed him like the wind The daily suns of years had shed no brighter gleam of reason on his mind no dawn had broken on his long dark night He would sit sometimes often for days together on a low seat by the fire or by the cottage door busy at work for he had learnt the art his mother plied and listening God help him to the tales she would repeat as a lure to keep him in her sight He had no recollection of these little narratives the tale of yesterday was new to him upon the morrow but he liked them at the moment and when the humour held him would remain patiently within doors hearing her stories like a little child and working cheerfully from sunrise until it was too dark to see At other times and then their scanty earnings were barely sufficient to furnish them with food though of the coarsest sort he would wander abroad from dawn of day until the twilight deepened into night Few in that place even of the children could be idle and he had no companions of his own kind Indeed there were not many who could have kept up with him in his rambles had there been a legion But there were a score of vagabond dogs belonging to the neighbours who served his purpose quite as well With two or three of these or sometimes with a full half dozen barking at his heels he would sally forth on some long expedition that consumed the day and though on their return at nightfall the dogs would come home limping and sore footed and almost spent with their fatigue Barnaby was up and off again at sunrise with some new attendants of the same class with whom he would return in like manner On all these travels Grip in his little basket at his master s back was a constant member of the party and when they set off in fine weather and in high spirits no dog barked louder than the raven Their pleasures on these excursions were simple enough A crust of bread and scrap of meat with water from the brook or spring sufficed for their repast Barnaby s enjoyments were to walk and run and leap till he was tired then to lie down in the long grass or by the growing corn or in the shade of some tall tree looking upward at the light clouds as they floated over the blue surface of the sky and listening to the lark as she poured out her brilliant song There were wild flowers to pluck the bright red poppy the gentle harebell the cowslip and the rose There were birds to watch fish ants worms hares or rabbits as they darted across the distant pathway in the wood and so were gone millions of living things to have an interest in and lie in wait for and clap hands and shout in memory of when they had disappeared In default of these or when they wearied there was the merry sunlight to hunt out as it crept in aslant through leaves and boughs of trees and hid far down deep deep in hollow places like a silver pool where nodding branches seemed to bathe and sport sweet scents of summer air breathing over fields of beans or clover the perfume of wet leaves or moss the life of waving trees and shadows always changing When these or any of them tired or in excess of pleasing tempted him to shut his eyes there was slumber in the midst of all these soft delights with the gentle wind murmuring like music in his ears and everything around melting into one delicious dream Their hut for it was little more stood on the outskirts of the town at a short distance from the high road but in a secluded place where few chance passengers strayed at any season of the year It had a plot of garden ground attached which Barnaby in fits and starts of working trimmed and kept in order Within doors and without his mother laboured for their common good and hail rain snow or sunshine found no difference in her Though so far removed from the scenes of her past life and with so little thought or hope of ever visiting them again she seemed to have a strange desire to know what happened in the busy world Any old newspaper or scrap of intelligence from London she caught at with avidity The excitement it produced was not of a pleasurable kind for her manner at such times expressed the keenest anxiety and dread but it never faded in the least degree Then and in stormy winter nights when the wind blew loud and strong the old expression came into her face and she would be seized with a fit of trembling like one who had an ague But Barnaby noted little of this and putting a great constraint upon herself she usually recovered her accustomed manner before the change had caught his observation Grip was by no means an idle or unprofitable member of the humble household Partly by dint of Barnaby s tuition and partly by pursuing a species of self instruction common to his tribe and exerting his powers of observation to the utmost he had acquired a degree of sagacity which rendered him famous for miles round His conversational powers and surprising performances were the universal theme and as many persons came to see the wonderful raven and none left his exertions unrewarded when he condescended to exhibit which was not always for genius is capricious his earnings formed an important item in the common stock Indeed the bird himself appeared to know his value well for though he was perfectly free and unrestrained in the presence of Barnaby and his mother he maintained in public an amazing gravity and never stooped to any other gratuitous performances than biting the ankles of vagabond boys an exercise in which he much delighted killing a fowl or two occasionally and swallowing the dinners of various neighbouring dogs of whom the boldest held him in great awe and dread Time had glided on in this way and nothing had happened to disturb or change their mode of life when one summer s night in June they were in their little garden resting from the labours of the day The widow s work was yet upon her knee and strewn upon the ground about her and Barnaby stood leaning on his spade gazing at the brightness in the west and singing softly to himself A brave evening mother If we had chinking in our pockets but a few specks of that gold which is piled up yonder in the sky we should be rich for life We are better as we are returned the widow with a quiet smile Let us be contented and we do not want and need not care to have it though it lay shining at our feet Ay said Barnaby resting with crossed arms on his spade and looking wistfully at the sunset that s well enough mother but gold s a good thing to have I wish that I knew where to find it Grip and I could do much with gold be sure of that What would you do she asked What A world of things We d dress finely you and I I mean not Grip keep horses dogs wear bright colours and feathers do no more work live delicately and at our ease Oh we d find uses for it mother and uses that would do us good I would I knew where gold was buried How hard I d work to dig it up You do not know said his mother rising from her seat and laying her hand upon his shoulder what men have done to win it and how they have found too late that it glitters brightest at a distance and turns quite dim and dull when handled Ay ay so you say so you think he answered still looking eagerly in the same direction For all that mother I should like to try Do you not see she said how red it is Nothing bears so many stains of blood as gold Avoid it None have such cause to hate its name as we have Do not so much as think of it dear love It has brought such misery and suffering on your head and mine as few have known and God grant few may have to undergo I would rather we were dead and laid down in our graves than you should ever come to love it For a moment Barnaby withdrew his eyes and looked at her with wonder Then glancing from the redness in the sky to the mark upon his wrist as if he would compare the two he seemed about to question her with earnestness when a new object caught his wandering attention and made him quite forgetful of his purpose This was a man with dusty feet and garments who stood bare headed behind the hedge that divided their patch of garden from the pathway and leant meekly forward as if he sought to mingle with their conversation and waited for his time to speak His face was turned towards the brightness too but the light that fell upon it showed that he was blind and saw it not A blessing on those voices said the wayfarer I feel the beauty of the night more keenly when I hear them They are like eyes to me Will they speak again and cheer the heart of a poor traveller Have you no guide asked the widow after a moment s pause None but that he answered pointing with his staff towards the sun and sometimes a milder one at night but she is idle now Have you travelled far A weary way and long rejoined the traveller as he shook his head A weary weary way I struck my stick just now upon the bucket of your well be pleased to let me have a draught of water lady Why do you call me lady she returned I am as poor as you Your speech is soft and gentle and I judge by that replied the man The coarsest stuffs and finest silks are apart from the sense of touch alike to me I cannot judge you by your dress Come round this way said Barnaby who had passed out at the garden gate and now stood close beside him Put your hand in mine You re blind and always in the dark eh Are you frightened in the dark Do you see great crowds of faces now Do they grin and chatter Alas returned the other I see nothing Waking or sleeping nothing Barnaby looked curiously at his eyes and touching them with his fingers as an inquisitive child might led him towards the house You have come a long distance said the widow meeting him at the door How have you found your way so far Use and necessity are good teachers as I have heard the best of any said the blind man sitting down upon the chair to which Barnaby had led him and putting his hat and stick upon the red tiled floor May neither you nor your son ever learn under them They are rough masters You have wandered from the road too said the widow in a tone of pity Maybe maybe returned the blind man with a sigh and yet with something of a smile upon his face that s likely Handposts and milestones are dumb indeed to me Thank you the more for this rest and this refreshing drink As he spoke he raised the mug of water to his mouth It was clear and cold and sparkling but not to his taste nevertheless or his thirst was not very great for he only wetted his lips and put it down again He wore hanging with a long strap round his neck a kind of scrip or wallet in which to carry food The widow set some bread and cheese before him but he thanked her and said that through the kindness of the charitable he had broken his fast once since morning and was not hungry When he had made her this reply he opened his wallet and took out a few pence which was all it appeared to contain Might I make bold to ask he said turning towards where Barnaby stood looking on that one who has the gift of sight would lay this out for me in bread to keep me on my way Heaven s blessing on the young feet that will bestir themselves in aid of one so helpless as a sightless man Barnaby looked at his mother who nodded assent in another moment he was gone upon his charitable errand The blind man sat listening with an attentive face until long after the sound of his retreating footsteps was inaudible to the widow and then said suddenly and in a very altered tone There are various degrees and kinds of blindness widow There is the connubial blindness ma am which perhaps you may have observed in the course of your own experience and which is a kind of wilful and self bandaging blindness There is the blindness of party ma am and public men which is the blindness of a mad bull in the midst of a regiment of soldiers clothed in red There is the blind confidence of youth which is the blindness of young kittens whose eyes have not yet opened on the world and there is that physical blindness ma am of which I am contrairy to my own desire a most illustrious example Added to these ma am is that blindness of the intellect of which we have a specimen in your interesting son and which having sometimes glimmerings and dawnings of the light is scarcely to be trusted as a total darkness Therefore ma am I have taken the liberty to get him out of the way for a short time while you and I confer together and this precaution arising out of the delicacy of my sentiments towards yourself you will excuse me ma am I know Having delivered himself of this speech with many flourishes of manner he drew from beneath his coat a flat stone bottle and holding the cork between his teeth qualified his mug of water with a plentiful infusion of the liquor it contained He politely drained the bumper to her health and the ladies and setting it down empty smacked his lips with infinite relish I am a citizen of the world ma am said the blind man corking his bottle and if I seem to conduct myself with freedom it is therefore You wonder who I am ma am and what has brought me here Such experience of human nature as I have leads me to that conclusion without the aid of eyes by which to read the movements of your soul as depicted in your feminine features I will satisfy your curiosity immediately ma am immediately With that he slapped his bottle on its broad back and having put it under his garment as before crossed his legs and folded his hands and settled himself in his chair previous to proceeding any further The change in his manner was so unexpected the craft and wickedness of his deportment were so much aggravated by his condition for we are accustomed to see in those who have lost a human sense something in its place almost divine and this alteration bred so many fears in her whom he addressed that she could not pronounce one word After waiting as it seemed for some remark or answer and waiting in vain the visitor resumed Madam my name is Stagg A friend of mine who has desired the honour of meeting with you any time these five years past has commissioned me to call upon you I should be glad to whisper that gentleman s name in your ear Zounds ma am are you deaf Do you hear me say that I should be glad to whisper my friend s name in your ear You need not repeat it said the widow with a stifled groan I see too well from whom you come But as a man of honour ma am said the blind man striking himself on the breast whose credentials must not be disputed I take leave to say that I WILL mention that gentleman s name Ay ay he added seeming to catch with his quick ear the very motion of her hand but not aloud With your leave ma am I desire the favour of a whisper She moved towards him and stooped down He muttered a word in her ear and wringing her hands she paced up and down the room like one distracted The blind man with perfect composure produced his bottle again mixed another glassful put it up as before and drinking from time to time followed her with his face in silence You are slow in conversation widow he said after a time pausing in his draught We shall have to talk before your son What would you have me do she answered What do you want We are poor widow we are poor he retorted stretching out his right hand and rubbing his thumb upon its palm Poor she cried And what am I Comparisons are odious said the blind man I don t know I don t care I say that we are poor My friend s circumstances are indifferent and so are mine We must have our rights widow or we must be bought off But you know that as well as I so where is the use of talking She still walked wildly to and fro At length stopping abruptly before him she said Is he near here He is Close at hand Then I am lost Not lost widow said the blind man calmly only found Shall I call him Not for the world she answered with a shudder Very good he replied crossing his legs again for he had made as though he would rise and walk to the door As you please widow His presence is not necessary that I know of But both he and I must live to live we must eat and drink to eat and drink we must have money I say no more Do you know how pinched and destitute I am she retorted I do not think you do or can If you had eyes and could look around you on this poor place you would have pity on me Oh let your heart be softened by your own affliction friend and have some sympathy with mine The blind man snapped his fingers as he answered Beside the question ma am beside the question I have the softest heart in the world but I can t live upon it Many a gentleman lives well upon a soft head who would find a heart of the same quality a very great drawback Listen to me This is a matter of business with which sympathies and sentiments have nothing to do As a mutual friend I wish to arrange it in a satisfactory manner if possible and thus the case stands If you are very poor now it s your own choice You have friends who in case of need are always ready to help you My friend is in a more destitute and desolate situation than most men and you and he being linked together in a common cause he naturally looks to you to assist him He has boarded and lodged with me a long time for as I said just now I am very soft hearted and I quite approve of his entertaining this opinion You have always had a roof over your head he has always been an outcast You have your son to comfort and assist you he has nobody at all The advantages must not be all one side You are in the same boat and we must divide the ballast a little more equally She was about to speak but he checked her and went on The only way of doing this is by making up a little purse now and then for my friend and that s what I advise He bears you no malice that I know of ma am so little that although you have treated him harshly more than once and driven him I may say out of doors he has that regard for you that I believe even if you disappointed him now he would consent to take charge of your son and to make a man of him He laid a great stress on these latter words and paused as if to find out what effect they had produced She only answered by her tears He is a likely lad said the blind man thoughtfully for many purposes and not ill disposed to try his fortune in a little change and bustle if I may judge from what I heard of his talk with you to night Come In a word my friend has pressing necessity for twenty pounds You who can give up an annuity can get that sum for him It s a pity you should be troubled You seem very comfortable here and it s worth that much to remain so Twenty pounds widow is a moderate demand You know where to apply for it a post will bring it you Twenty pounds She was about to answer him again but again he stopped her Don t say anything hastily you might be sorry for it Think of it a little while Twenty pounds of other people s money how easy Turn it over in your mind I m in no hurry Night s coming on and if I don t sleep here I shall not go far Twenty pounds Consider of it ma am for twenty minutes give each pound a minute that s a fair allowance I ll enjoy the air the while which is very mild and pleasant in these parts With these words he groped his way to the door carrying his chair with him Then seating himself under a spreading honeysuckle and stretching his legs across the threshold so that no person could pass in or out without his knowledge he took from his pocket a pipe flint steel and tinder box and began to smoke It was a lovely evening of that gentle kind and at that time of year when the twilight is most beautiful Pausing now and then to let his smoke curl slowly off and to sniff the grateful fragrance of the flowers he sat there at his ease as though the cottage were his proper dwelling and he had held undisputed possession of it all his life waiting for the widow s answer and for Barnaby s return Chapter 46 When Barnaby returned with the bread the sight of the pious old pilgrim smoking his pipe and making himself so thoroughly at home appeared to surprise even him the more so as that worthy person instead of putting up the loaf in his wallet as a scarce and precious article tossed it carelessly on the table and producing his bottle bade him sit down and drink For I carry some comfort you see he said Taste that Is it good The water stood in Barnaby s eyes as he coughed from the strength of the draught and answered in the affirmative Drink some more said the blind man don t be afraid of it You don t taste anything like that often eh Often cried Barnaby Never Too poor returned the blind man with a sigh Ay That s bad Your mother poor soul would be happier if she was richer Barnaby Why so I tell her the very thing I told her just before you came to night when all that gold was in the sky said Barnaby drawing his chair nearer to him and looking eagerly in his face Tell me Is there any way of being rich that I could find out Any way A hundred ways Ay ay he returned Do you say so What are they Nay mother it s for your sake I ask not mine for yours indeed What are they The blind man turned his face on which there was a smile of triumph to where the widow stood in great distress and answered Why they are not to be found out by stay at homes my good friend By stay at homes cried Barnaby plucking at his sleeve But I am not one Now there you mistake I am often out before the sun and travel home when he has gone to rest I am away in the woods before the day has reached the shady places and am often there when the bright moon is peeping through the boughs and looking down upon the other moon that lives in the water As I walk along I try to find among the grass and moss some of that small money for which she works so hard and used to shed so many tears As I lie asleep in the shade I dream of it dream of digging it up in heaps and spying it out hidden under bushes and seeing it sparkle as the dew drops do among the leaves But I never find it Tell me where it is I d go there if the journey were a whole year long because I know she would be happier when I came home and brought some with me Speak again I ll listen to you if you talk all night The blind man passed his hand lightly over the poor fellow s face and finding that his elbows were planted on the table that his chin rested on his two hands that he leaned eagerly forward and that his whole manner expressed the utmost interest and anxiety paused for a minute as though he desired the widow to observe this fully and then made answer It s in the world bold Barnaby the merry world not in solitary places like those you pass your time in but in crowds and where there s noise and rattle Good good cried Barnaby rubbing his hands Yes I love that Grip loves it too It suits us both That s brave The kind of places said the blind man that a young fellow likes and in which a good son may do more for his mother and himself to boot in a month than he could here in all his life that is if he had a friend you know and some one to advise with You hear this mother cried Barnaby turning to her with delight Never tell me we shouldn t heed it if it lay shining at out feet Why do we heed it so much now Why do you toil from morning until night Surely said the blind man surely Have you no answer widow Is your mind he slowly added not made up yet Let me speak with you she answered apart Lay your hand upon my sleeve said Stagg arising from the table and lead me where you will Courage bold Barnaby We ll talk more of this I ve a fancy for you Wait there till I come back Now widow She led him out at the door and into the little garden where they stopped You are a fit agent she said in a half breathless manner and well represent the man who sent you here I ll tell him that you said so Stagg retorted He has a regard for you and will respect me the more if possible for your praise We must have our rights widow Rights Do you know she said that a word from me Why do you stop returned the blind man calmly after a long pause Do I know that a word from you would place my friend in the last position of the dance of life Yes I do What of that It will never be spoken widow You are sure of that Quite so sure that I don t come here to discuss the question I say we must have our rights or we must be bought off Keep to that point or let me return to my young friend for I have an interest in the lad and desire to put him in the way of making his fortune Bah you needn t speak he added hastily I know what you would say you have hinted at it once already Have I no feeling for you because I am blind No I have not Why do you expect me being in darkness to be better than men who have their sight why should you Is the hand of Heaven more manifest in my having no eyes than in your having two It s the cant of you folks to be horrified if a blind man robs or lies or steals oh yes it s far worse in him who can barely live on the few halfpence that are thrown to him in streets than in you who can see and work and are not dependent on the mercies of the world A curse on you You who have five senses may be wicked at your pleasure we who have four and want the most important are to live and be moral on our affliction The true charity and justice of rich to poor all the world over He paused a moment when he had said these words and caught the sound of money jingling in her hand Well he cried quickly resuming his former manner That should lead to something The point widow First answer me one question she replied You say he is close at hand Has he left London Being close at hand widow it would seem he has returned the blind man I mean for good You know that Yes for good The truth is widow that his making a longer stay there might have had disagreeable consequences He has come away for that reason Listen said the widow telling some money out upon a bench beside them Count Six said the blind man listening attentively Any more They are the savings she answered of five years Six guineas He put out his hand for one of the coins felt it carefully put it between his teeth rung it on the bench and nodded to her to proceed These have been scraped together and laid by lest sickness or death should separate my son and me They have been purchased at the price of much hunger hard labour and want of rest If you CAN take them do on condition that you leave this place upon the instant and enter no more into that room where he sits now expecting your return Six guineas said the blind man shaking his head though of the fullest weight that were ever coined fall very far short of twenty pounds widow For such a sum as you know I must write to a distant part of the country To do that and receive an answer I must have time Two days said Stagg More Four days A week Return on this day week at the same hour but not to the house Wait at the corner of the lane Of course said the blind man with a crafty look I shall find you there Where else can I take refuge Is it not enough that you have made a beggar of me and that I have sacrificed my whole store so hardly earned to preserve this home Humph said the blind man after some consideration Set me with my face towards the point you speak of and in the middle of the road Is this the spot It is On this day week at sunset And think of him within doors For the present good night She made him no answer nor did he stop for any He went slowly away turning his head from time to time and stopping to listen as if he were curious to know whether he was watched by any one The shadows of night were closing fast around and he was soon lost in the gloom It was not however until she had traversed the lane from end to end and made sure that he was gone that she re entered the cottage and hurriedly barred the door and window Mother said Barnaby What is the matter Where is the blind man He is gone Gone he cried starting up I must have more talk with him Which way did he take I don t know she answered folding her arms about him You must not go out to night There are ghosts and dreams abroad Ay said Barnaby in a frightened whisper It is not safe to stir We must leave this place to morrow This place This cottage and the little garden mother Yes To morrow morning at sunrise We must travel to London lose ourselves in that wide place there would be some trace of us in any other town then travel on again and find some new abode Little persuasion was required to reconcile Barnaby to anything that promised change In another minute he was wild with delight in another full of grief at the prospect of parting with his friends the dogs in another wild again then he was fearful of what she had said to prevent his wandering abroad that night and full of terrors and strange questions His light heartedness in the end surmounted all his other feelings and lying down in his clothes to the end that he might be ready on the morrow he soon fell fast asleep before the poor turf fire His mother did not close her eyes but sat beside him watching Every breath of wind sounded in her ears like that dreaded footstep at the door or like that hand upon the latch and made the calm summer night a night of horror At length the welcome day appeared When she had made the little preparations which were needful for their journey and had prayed upon her knees with many tears she roused Barnaby who jumped up gaily at her summons His clothes were few enough and to carry Grip was a labour of love As the sun shed his earliest beams upon the earth they closed the door of their deserted home and turned away The sky was blue and bright The air was fresh and filled with a thousand perfumes Barnaby looked upward and laughed with all his heart But it was a day he usually devoted to a long ramble and one of the dogs the ugliest of them all came bounding up and jumping round him in the fulness of his joy He had to bid him go back in a surly tone and his heart smote him while he did so The dog retreated turned with a half incredulous half imploring look came a little back and stopped It was the last appeal of an old companion and a faithful friend cast off Barnaby could bear no more and as he shook his head and waved his playmate home he burst into tears Oh mother mother how mournful he will be when he scratches at the door and finds it always shut There was such a sense of home in the thought that though her own eyes overflowed she would not have obliterated the recollection of it either from her own mind or from his for the wealth of the whole wide world Chapter 47 In the exhaustless catalogue of Heaven s mercies to mankind the power we have of finding some germs of comfort in the hardest trials must ever occupy the foremost place not only because it supports and upholds us when we most require to be sustained but because in this source of consolation there is something we have reason to believe of the divine spirit something of that goodness which detects amidst our own evil doings a redeeming quality something which even in our fallen nature we possess in common with the angels which had its being in the old time when they trod the earth and lingers on it yet in pity How often on their journey did the widow remember with a grateful heart that out of his deprivation Barnaby s cheerfulness and affection sprung How often did she call to mind that but for that he might have been sullen morose unkind far removed from her vicious perhaps and cruel How often had she cause for comfort in his strength and hope and in his simple nature Those feeble powers of mind which rendered him so soon forgetful of the past save in brief gleams and flashes even they were a comfort now The world to him was full of happiness in every tree and plant and flower in every bird and beast and tiny insect whom a breath of summer wind laid low upon the ground he had delight His delight was hers and where many a wise son would have made her sorrowful this poor light hearted idiot filled her breast with thankfulness and love Their stock of money was low but from the hoard she had told into the blind man s hand the widow had withheld one guinea This with the few pence she possessed besides was to two persons of their frugal habits a goodly sum in bank Moreover they had Grip in company and when they must otherwise have changed the guinea it was but to make him exhibit outside an alehouse door or in a village street or in the grounds or gardens of a mansion of the better sort and scores who would have given nothing in charity were ready to bargain for more amusement from the talking bird One day for they moved slowly and although they had many rides in carts and waggons were on the road a week Barnaby with Grip upon his shoulder and his mother following begged permission at a trim lodge to go up to the great house at the other end of the avenue and show his raven The man within was inclined to give them admittance and was indeed about to do so when a stout gentleman with a long whip in his hand and a flushed face which seemed to indicate that he had had his morning s draught rode up to the gate and called in a loud voice and with more oaths than the occasion seemed to warrant to have it opened directly Who hast thou got here said the gentleman angrily as the man threw the gate wide open and pulled off his hat who are these Eh art a beggar woman The widow answered with a curtsey that they were poor travellers Vagrants said the gentleman vagrants and vagabonds Thee wish to be made acquainted with the cage dost thee the cage the stocks and the whipping post Where dost come from She told him in a timid manner for he was very loud hoarse and red faced and besought him not to be angry for they meant no harm and would go upon their way that moment Don t he too sure of that replied the gentleman we don t allow vagrants to roam about this place I know what thou want st stray linen drying on hedges and stray poultry eh What hast got in that basket lazy hound Grip Grip Grip Grip the clever Grip the wicked Grip the knowing Grip Grip Grip cried the raven whom Barnaby had shut up on the approach of this stern personage I m a devil I m a devil I m a devil Never say die Hurrah Bow wow wow Polly put the kettle on we ll all have tea Take the vermin out scoundrel said the gentleman and let me see him Barnaby thus condescendingly addressed produced his bird but not without much fear and trembling and set him down upon the ground which he had no sooner done than Grip drew fifty corks at least and then began to dance at the same time eyeing the gentleman with surprising insolence of manner and screwing his head so much on one side that he appeared desirous of screwing it off upon the spot The cork drawing seemed to make a greater impression on the gentleman s mind than the raven s power of speech and was indeed particularly adapted to his habits and capacity He desired to have that done again but despite his being very peremptory and notwithstanding that Barnaby coaxed to the utmost Grip turned a deaf ear to the request and preserved a dead silence Bring him along said the gentleman pointing to the house But Grip who had watched the action anticipated his master by hopping on before them constantly flapping his wings and screaming cook meanwhile as a hint perhaps that there was company coming and a small collation would be acceptable Barnaby and his mother walked on on either side of the gentleman on horseback who surveyed each of them from time to time in a proud and coarse manner and occasionally thundered out some question the tone of which alarmed Barnaby so much that he could find no answer and as a matter of course could make him no reply On one of these occasions when the gentleman appeared disposed to exercise his horsewhip the widow ventured to inform him in a low voice and with tears in her eyes that her son was of weak mind An idiot eh said the gentleman looking at Barnaby as he spoke And how long hast thou been an idiot She knows was Barnaby s timid answer pointing to his mother I always I believe From his birth said the widow I don t believe it cried the gentleman not a bit of it It s an excuse not to work There s nothing like flogging to cure that disorder I d make a difference in him in ten minutes I ll be bound Heaven has made none in more than twice ten years sir said the widow mildly Then why don t you shut him up we pay enough for county institutions damn em But thou d rather drag him about to excite charity of course Ay I know thee Now this gentleman had various endearing appellations among his intimate friends By some he was called a country gentleman of the true school by some a fine old country gentleman by some a sporting gentleman by some a thorough bred Englishman by some a genuine John Bull but they all agreed in one respect and that was that it was a pity there were not more like him and that because there were not the country was going to rack and ruin every day He was in the commission of the peace and could write his name almost legibly but his greatest qualifications were that he was more severe with poachers was a better shot a harder rider had better horses kept better dogs could eat more solid food drink more strong wine go to bed every night more drunk and get up every morning more sober than any man in the county In knowledge of horseflesh he was almost equal to a farrier in stable learning he surpassed his own head groom and in gluttony not a pig on his estate was a match for him He had no seat in Parliament himself but he was extremely patriotic and usually drove his voters up to the poll with his own hands He was warmly attached to church and state and never appointed to the living in his gift any but a three bottle man and a first rate fox hunter He mistrusted the honesty of all poor people who could read and write and had a secret jealousy of his own wife a young lady whom he had married for what his friends called the good old English reason that her father s property adjoined his own for possessing those accomplishments in a greater degree than himself In short Barnaby being an idiot and Grip a creature of mere brute instinct it would be very hard to say what this gentleman was He rode up to the door of a handsome house approached by a great flight of steps where a man was waiting to take his horse and led the way into a large hall which spacious as it was was tainted with the fumes of last night s stale debauch Greatcoats riding whips bridles top boots spurs and such gear were strewn about on all sides and formed with some huge stags antlers and a few portraits of dogs and horses its principal embellishments Throwing himself into a great chair in which by the bye he often snored away the night when he had been according to his admirers a finer country gentleman than usual he bade the man to tell his mistress to come down and presently there appeared a little flurried as it seemed by the unwonted summons a lady much younger than himself who had the appearance of being in delicate health and not too happy Here Thou st no delight in following the hounds as an Englishwoman should have said the gentleman See to this here That ll please thee perhaps The lady smiled sat down at a little distance from him and glanced at Barnaby with a look of pity He s an idiot the woman says observed the gentleman shaking his head I don t believe it Are you his mother asked the lady She answered yes What s the use of asking HER said the gentleman thrusting his hands into his breeches pockets She ll tell thee so of course Most likely he s hired at so much a day There Get on Make him do something Grip having by this time recovered his urbanity condescended at Barnaby s solicitation to repeat his various phrases of speech and to go through the whole of his performances with the utmost success The corks and the never say die afforded the gentleman so much delight that he demanded the repetition of this part of the entertainment until Grip got into his basket and positively refused to say another word good or bad The lady too was much amused with him and the closing point of his obstinacy so delighted her husband that he burst into a roar of laughter and demanded his price Barnaby looked as though he didn t understand his meaning Probably he did not His price said the gentleman rattling the money in his pockets what dost want for him How much He s not to be sold replied Barnaby shutting up the basket in a great hurry and throwing the strap over his shoulder Mother come away Thou seest how much of an idiot he is book learner said the gentleman looking scornfully at his wife He can make a bargain What dost want for him old woman He is my son s constant companion said the widow He is not to be sold sir indeed Not to be sold cried the gentleman growing ten times redder hoarser and louder than before Not to be sold Indeed no she answered We have never thought of parting with him sir I do assure you He was evidently about to make a very passionate retort when a few murmured words from his wife happening to catch his ear he turned sharply round and said Eh What We can hardly expect them to sell the bird against their own desire she faltered If they prefer to keep him Prefer to keep him he echoed These people who go tramping about the country a pilfering and vagabondising on all hands prefer to keep a bird when a landed proprietor and a justice asks his price That old woman s been to school I know she has Don t tell me no he roared to the widow I say yes Barnaby s mother pleaded guilty to the accusation and hoped there was no harm in it No harm said the gentleman No No harm No harm ye old rebel not a bit of harm If my clerk was here I d set ye in the stocks I would or lay ye in jail for prowling up and down on the look out for petty larcenies ye limb of a gipsy Here Simon put these pilferers out shove em into the road out with em Ye don t want to sell the bird ye that come here to beg don t ye If they an t out in double quick set the dogs upon em They waited for no further dismissal but fled precipitately leaving the gentleman to storm away by himself for the poor lady had already retreated and making a great many vain attempts to silence Grip who excited by the noise drew corks enough for a city feast as they hurried down the avenue and appeared to congratulate himself beyond measure on having been the cause of the disturbance When they had nearly reached the lodge another servant emerging from the shrubbery feigned to be very active in ordering them off but this man put a crown into the widow s hand and whispering that his lady sent it thrust them gently from the gate This incident only suggested to the widow s mind when they halted at an alehouse some miles further on and heard the justice s character as given by his friends that perhaps something more than capacity of stomach and tastes for the kennel and the stable were required to form either a perfect country gentleman a thoroughbred Englishman or a genuine John Bull and that possibly the terms were sometimes misappropriated not to say disgraced She little thought then that a circumstance so slight would ever influence their future fortunes but time and experience enlightened her in this respect Mother said Barnaby as they were sitting next day in a waggon which was to take them within ten miles of the capital we re going to London first you said Shall we see that blind man there She was about to answer Heaven forbid but checked herself and told him No she thought not why did he ask He s a wise man said Barnaby with a thoughtful countenance I wish that we may meet with him again What was it that he said of crowds That gold was to be found where people crowded and not among the trees and in such quiet places He spoke as if he loved it London is a crowded place I think we shall meet him there But why do you desire to see him love she asked Because said Barnaby looking wistfully at her he talked to me about gold which is a rare thing and say what you will a thing you would like to have I know And because he came and went away so strangely just as white headed old men come sometimes to my bed s foot in the night and say what I can t remember when the bright day returns He told me he d come back I wonder why he broke his word But you never thought of being rich or gay before dear Barnaby You have always been contented He laughed and bade her say that again then cried Ay ay oh yes and laughed once more Then something passed that caught his fancy and the topic wandered from his mind and was succeeded by another just as fleeting But it was plain from what he had said and from his returning to the point more than once that day and on the next that the blind man s visit and indeed his words had taken strong possession of his mind Whether the idea of wealth had occurred to him for the first time on looking at the golden clouds that evening and images were often presented to his thoughts by outward objects quite as remote and distant or whether their poor and humble way of life had suggested it by contrast long ago or whether the accident as he would deem it of the blind man s pursuing the current of his own remarks had done so at the moment or he had been impressed by the mere circumstance of the man being blind and therefore unlike any one with whom he had talked before it was impossible to tell She tried every means to discover but in vain and the probability is that Barnaby himself was equally in the dark It filled her with uneasiness to find him harping on this string but all that she could do was to lead him quickly to some other subject and to dismiss it from his brain To caution him against their visitor to show any fear or suspicion in reference to him would only be she feared to increase that interest with which Barnaby regarded him and to strengthen his desire to meet him once again She hoped by plunging into the crowd to rid herself of her terrible pursuer and then by journeying to a distance and observing increased caution if that were possible to live again unknown in secrecy and peace They reached in course of time their halting place within ten miles of London and lay there for the night after bargaining to be carried on for a trifle next day in a light van which was returning empty and was to start at five o clock in the morning The driver was punctual the road good save for the dust the weather being very hot and dry and at seven in the forenoon of Friday the second of June one thousand seven hundred and eighty they alighted at the foot of Westminster Bridge bade their conductor farewell and stood alone together on the scorching pavement For the freshness which night sheds upon such busy thoroughfares had already departed and the sun was shining with uncommon lustre Chapter 48 Uncertain where to go next and bewildered by the crowd of people who were already astir they sat down in one of the recesses on the bridge to rest They soon became aware that the stream of life was all pouring one way and that a vast throng of persons were crossing the river from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore in unusual haste and evident excitement They were for the most part in knots of two or three or sometimes half a dozen they spoke little together many of them were quite silent and hurried on as if they had one absorbing object in view which was common to them all They were surprised to see that nearly every man in this great concourse which still came pouring past without slackening in the least wore in his hat a blue cockade and that the chance passengers who were not so decorated appeared timidly anxious to escape observation or attack and gave them the wall as if they would conciliate them This however was natural enough considering their inferiority in point of numbers for the proportion of those who wore blue cockades to those who were dressed as usual was at least forty or fifty to one There was no quarrelling however the blue cockades went swarming on passing each other when they could and making all the speed that was possible in such a multitude and exchanged nothing more than looks and very often not even those with such of the passers by as were not of their number At first the current of people had been confined to the two pathways and but a few more eager stragglers kept the road But after half an hour or so the passage was completely blocked up by the great press which being now closely wedged together and impeded by the carts and coaches it encountered moved but slowly and was sometimes at a stand for five or ten minutes together After the lapse of nearly two hours the numbers began to diminish visibly and gradually dwindling away by little and little left the bridge quite clear save that now and then some hot and dusty man with the cockade in his hat and his coat thrown over his shoulder went panting by fearful of being too late or stopped to ask which way his friends had taken and being directed hastened on again like one refreshed In this comparative solitude which seemed quite strange and novel after the late crowd the widow had for the first time an opportunity of inquiring of an old man who came and sat beside them what was the meaning of that great assemblage Why where have you come from he returned that you haven t heard of Lord George Gordon s great association This is the day that he presents the petition against the Catholics God bless him What have all these men to do with that she said What have they to do with it the old man replied Why how you talk Don t you know his lordship has declared he won t present it to the house at all unless it is attended to the door by forty thousand good and true men at least There s a crowd for you A crowd indeed said Barnaby Do you hear that mother And they re mustering yonder as I am told resumed the old man nigh upon a hundred thousand strong Ah Let Lord George alone He knows his power There ll be a good many faces inside them three windows over there and he pointed to where the House of Commons overlooked the river that ll turn pale when good Lord George gets up this afternoon and with reason too Ay ay Let his lordship alone Let him alone HE knows And so with much mumbling and chuckling and shaking of his forefinger he rose with the assistance of his stick and tottered off Mother said Barnaby that s a brave crowd he talks of Come Not to join it cried his mother Yes yes he answered plucking at her sleeve Why not Come You don t know she urged what mischief they may do where they may lead you what their meaning is Dear Barnaby for my sake For your sake he cried patting her hand Well It IS for your sake mother You remember what the blind man said about the gold Here s a brave crowd Come Or wait till I come back yes yes wait here She tried with all the earnestness her fears engendered to turn him from his purpose but in vain He was stooping down to buckle on his shoe when a hackney coach passed them rather quickly and a voice inside called to the driver to stop Young man said a voice within Who s that cried Barnaby looking up Do you wear this ornament returned the stranger holding out a blue cockade In Heaven s name no Pray do not give it him exclaimed the widow Speak for yourself woman said the man within the coach coldly Leave the young man to his choice he s old enough to make it and to snap your apron strings He knows without your telling whether he wears the sign of a loyal Englishman or not Barnaby trembling with impatience cried Yes yes yes I do as he had cried a dozen times already The man threw him a cockade and crying Make haste to St George s Fields ordered the coachman to drive on fast and left them With hands that trembled with his eagerness to fix the bauble in his hat Barnaby was adjusting it as he best could and hurriedly replying to the tears and entreaties of his mother when two gentlemen passed on the opposite side of the way Observing them and seeing how Barnaby was occupied they stopped whispered together for an instant turned back and came over to them Why are you sitting here said one of them who was dressed in a plain suit of black wore long lank hair and carried a great cane Why have you not gone with the rest I am going sir replied Barnaby finishing his task and putting his hat on with an air of pride I shall be there directly Say my lord young man when his lordship does you the honour of speaking to you said the second gentleman mildly If you don t know Lord George Gordon when you see him it s high time you should Nay Gashford said Lord George as Barnaby pulled off his hat again and made him a low bow it s no great matter on a day like this which every Englishman will remember with delight and pride Put on your hat friend and follow us for you lag behind and are late It s past ten now Didn t you know that the hour for assembling was ten o clock Barnaby shook his head and looked vacantly from one to the other You might have known it friend said Gashford it was perfectly understood How came you to be so ill informed He cannot tell you sir the widow interposed It s of no use to ask him We are but this morning come from a long distance in the country and know nothing of these matters The cause has taken a deep root and has spread its branches far and wide said Lord George to his secretary This is a pleasant hearing I thank Heaven for it Amen cried Gashford with a solemn face You do not understand me my lord said the widow Pardon me but you cruelly mistake my meaning We know nothing of these matters We have no desire or right to join in what you are about to do This is my son my poor afflicted son dearer to me than my own life In mercy s name my lord go your way alone and do not tempt him into danger My good woman said Gashford how can you Dear me What do you mean by tempting and by danger Do you think his lordship is a roaring lion going about and seeking whom he may devour God bless me No no my lord forgive me implored the widow laying both her hands upon his breast and scarcely knowing what she did or said in the earnestness of her supplication but there are reasons why you should hear my earnest mother s prayer and leave my son with me Oh do He is not in his right senses he is not indeed It is a bad sign of the wickedness of these times said Lord George evading her touch and colouring deeply that those who cling to the truth and support the right cause are set down as mad Have you the heart to say this of your own son unnatural mother I am astonished at you said Gashford with a kind of meek severity This is a very sad picture of female depravity He has surely no appearance said Lord George glancing at Barnaby and whispering in his secretary s ear of being deranged And even if he had we must not construe any trifling peculiarity into madness Which of us and here he turned red again would be safe if that were made the law Not one replied the secretary in that case the greater the zeal the truth and talent the more direct the call from above the clearer would be the madness With regard to this young man my lord he added with a lip that slightly curled as he looked at Barnaby who stood twirling his hat and stealthily beckoning them to come away he is as sensible and self possessed as any one I ever saw And you desire to make one of this great body said Lord George addressing him and intended to make one did you Yes yes said Barnaby with sparkling eyes To be sure I did I told her so myself I see replied Lord George with a reproachful glance at the unhappy mother I thought so Follow me and this gentleman and you shall have your wish Barnaby kissed his mother tenderly on the cheek and bidding her be of good cheer for their fortunes were both made now did as he was desired She poor woman followed too with how much fear and grief it would be hard to tell They passed quickly through the Bridge Road where the shops were all shut up for the passage of the great crowd and the expectation of their return had alarmed the tradesmen for their goods and windows and where in the upper stories all the inhabitants were congregated looking down into the street below with faces variously expressive of alarm of interest expectancy and indignation Some of these applauded and some hissed but regardless of these interruptions for the noise of a vast congregation of people at a little distance sounded in his ears like the roaring of the sea Lord George Gordon quickened his pace and presently arrived before St George s Fields They were really fields at that time and of considerable extent Here an immense multitude was collected bearing flags of various kinds and sizes but all of the same colour blue like the cockades some sections marching to and fro in military array and others drawn up in circles squares and lines A large portion both of the bodies which paraded the ground and of those which remained stationary were occupied in singing hymns or psalms With whomsoever this originated it was well done for the sound of so many thousand voices in the air must have stirred the heart of any man within him and could not fail to have a wonderful effect upon enthusiasts however mistaken Scouts had been posted in advance of the great body to give notice of their leader s coming These falling back the word was quickly passed through the whole host and for a short interval there ensued a profound and deathlike silence during which the mass was so still and quiet that the fluttering of a banner caught the eye and became a circumstance of note Then they burst into a tremendous shout into another and another and the air seemed rent and shaken as if by the discharge of cannon Gashford cried Lord George pressing his secretary s arm tight within his own and speaking with as much emotion in his voice as in his altered face I arn called indeed now I feel and know it I am the leader of a host If they summoned me at this moment with one voice to lead them on to death I d do it Yes and fall first myself It is a proud sight said the secretary It is a noble day for England and for the great cause throughout the world Such homage my lord as I an humble but devoted man can render What are you doing cried his master catching him by both hands for he had made a show of kneeling at his feet Do not unfit me dear Gashford for the solemn duty of this glorious day the tears stood in the eyes of the poor gentleman as he said the words Let us go among them we have to find a place in some division for this new recruit give me your hand Gashford slid his cold insidious palm into his master s grasp and so hand in hand and followed still by Barnaby and by his mother too they mingled with the concourse They had by this time taken to their singing again and as their leader passed between their ranks they raised their voices to their utmost Many of those who were banded together to support the religion of their country even unto death had never heard a hymn or psalm in all their lives But these fellows having for the most part strong lungs and being naturally fond of singing chanted any ribaldry or nonsense that occurred to them feeling pretty certain that it would not be detected in the general chorus and not caring much if it were Many of these voluntaries were sung under the very nose of Lord George Gordon who quite unconscious of their burden passed on with his usual stiff and solemn deportment very much edified and delighted by the pious conduct of his followers So they went on and on up this line down that round the exterior of this circle and on every side of that hollow square and still there were lines and squares and circles out of number to review The day being now intensely hot and the sun striking down his fiercest rays upon the field those who carried heavy banners began to grow faint and weary most of the number assembled were fain to pull off their neckcloths and throw their coats and waistcoats open and some towards the centre quite overpowered by the excessive heat which was of course rendered more unendurable by the multitude around them lay down upon the grass and offered all they had about them for a drink of water Still no man left the ground not even of those who were so distressed still Lord George streaming from every pore went on with Gashford and still Barnaby and his mother followed close behind them They had arrived at the top of a long line of some eight hundred men in single file and Lord George had turned his head to look back when a loud cry of recognition in that peculiar and half stifled tone which a voice has when it is raised in the open air and in the midst of a great concourse of persons was heard and a man stepped with a shout of laughter from the rank and smote Barnaby on the shoulders with his heavy hand How now he cried Barnaby Rudge Why where have you been hiding for these hundred years Barnaby had been thinking within himself that the smell of the trodden grass brought back his old days at cricket when he was a young boy and played on Chigwell Green Confused by this sudden and boisterous address he stared in a bewildered manner at the man and could scarcely say What Hugh Hugh echoed the other ay Hugh Maypole Hugh You remember my dog He s alive now and will know you I warrant What you wear the colour do you Well done Ha ha ha You know this young man I see said Lord George Know him my lord as well as I know my own right hand My captain knows him We all know him Will you take him into your division It hasn t in it a better nor a nimbler nor a more active man than Barnaby Rudge said Hugh Show me the man who says it has Fall in Barnaby He shall march my lord between me and Dennis and he shall carry he added taking a flag from the hand of a tired man who tendered it the gayest silken streamer in this valiant army In the name of God no shrieked the widow darting forward Barnaby my lord see he ll come back Barnaby Barnaby Women in the field cried Hugh stepping between them and holding her off Holloa My captain there What s the matter here cried Simon Tappertit bustling up in a great heat Do you call this order Nothing like it captain answered Hugh still holding her back with his outstretched hand It s against all orders Ladies are carrying off our gallant soldiers from their duty The word of command captain They re filing off the ground Quick Close cried Simon with the whole power of his lungs Form March She was thrown to the ground the whole field was in motion Barnaby was whirled away into the heart of a dense mass of men and she saw him no more Chapter 49 The mob had been divided from its first assemblage into four divisions the London the Westminster the Southwark and the Scotch Each of these divisions being subdivided into various bodies and these bodies being drawn up in various forms and figures the general arrangement was except to the few chiefs and leaders as unintelligible as the plan of a great battle to the meanest soldier in the field It was not without its method however for in a very short space of time after being put in motion the crowd had resolved itself into three great parties and were prepared as had been arranged to cross the river by different bridges and make for the House of Commons in separate detachments At the head of that division which had Westminster Bridge for its approach to the scene of action Lord George Gordon took his post with Gashford at his right hand and sundry ruffians of most unpromising appearance forming a kind of staff about him The conduct of a second party whose route lay by Blackfriars was entrusted to a committee of management including perhaps a dozen men while the third which was to go by London Bridge and through the main streets in order that their numbers and their serious intentions might be the better known and appreciated by the citizens were led by Simon Tappertit assisted by a few subalterns selected from the Brotherhood of United Bulldogs Dennis the hangman Hugh and some others The word of command being given each of these great bodies took the road assigned to it and departed on its way in perfect order and profound silence That which went through the City greatly exceeded the others in number and was of such prodigious extent that when the rear began to move the front was nearly four miles in advance notwithstanding that the men marched three abreast and followed very close upon each other At the head of this party in the place where Hugh in the madness of his humour had stationed him and walking between that dangerous companion and the hangman went Barnaby as many a man among the thousands who looked on that day afterwards remembered well Forgetful of all other things in the ecstasy of the moment his face flushed and his eyes sparkling with delight heedless of the weight of the great banner he carried and mindful only of its flashing in the sun and rustling in the summer breeze on he went proud happy elated past all telling the only light hearted undesigning creature in the whole assembly What do you think of this asked Hugh as they passed through the crowded streets and looked up at the windows which were thronged with spectators They have all turned out to see our flags and streamers Eh Barnaby Why Barnaby s the greatest man of all the pack His flag s the largest of the lot the brightest too There s nothing in the show like Barnaby All eyes are turned on him Ha ha ha Don t make that din brother growled the hangman glancing with no very approving eyes at Barnaby as he spoke I hope he don t think there s nothing to be done but carrying that there piece of blue rag like a boy at a breaking up You re ready for action I hope eh You I mean he added nudging Barnaby roughly with his elbow What are you staring at Why don t you speak Barnaby had been gazing at his flag and looked vacantly from his questioner to Hugh He don t understand your way said the latter Here I ll explain it to him Barnaby old boy attend to me I ll attend said Barnaby looking anxiously round but I wish I could see her somewhere See who demanded Dennis in a gruff tone You an t in love I hope brother That an t the sort of thing for us you know We mustn t have no love here She would be proud indeed to see me now eh Hugh said Barnaby Wouldn t it make her glad to see me at the head of this large show She d cry for joy I know she would Where CAN she be She never sees me at my best and what do I care to be gay and fine if SHE S not by Why what palaver s this asked Mr Dennis with supreme disdain We an t got no sentimental members among us I hope Don t be uneasy brother cried Hugh he s only talking of his mother Of his what said Mr Dennis with a strong oath His mother And have I combined myself with this here section and turned out on this here memorable day to hear men talk about their mothers growled Mr Dennis with extreme disgust The notion of a man s sweetheart s bad enough but a man s mother and here his disgust was so extreme that he spat upon the ground and could say no more Barnaby s right cried Hugh with a grin and I say it Lookee bold lad If she s not here to see it s because I ve provided for her and sent half a dozen gentlemen every one of em with a blue flag but not half as fine as yours to take her in state to a grand house all hung round with gold and silver banners and everything else you please where she ll wait till you come and want for nothing Ay said Barnaby his face beaming with delight have you indeed That s a good hearing That s fine Kind Hugh But nothing to what will come bless you retorted Hugh with a wink at Dennis who regarded his new companion in arms with great astonishment No indeed cried Barnaby Nothing at all said Hugh Money cocked hats and feathers red coats and gold lace all the fine things there are ever were or will be will belong to us if we are true to that noble gentleman the best man in the world carry our flags for a few days and keep em safe That s all we ve got to do Is that all cried Barnaby with glistening eyes as he clutched his pole the tighter I warrant you I keep this one safe then You have put it in good hands You know me Hugh Nobody shall wrest this flag away Well said cried Hugh Ha ha Nobly said That s the old stout Barnaby that I have climbed and leaped with many and many a day I knew I was not mistaken in Barnaby Don t you see man he added in a whisper as he slipped to the other side of Dennis that the lad s a natural and can be got to do anything if you take him the right way Letting alone the fun he is he s worth a dozen men in earnest as you d find if you tried a fall with him Leave him to me You shall soon see whether he s of use or not Mr Dennis received these explanatory remarks with many nods and winks and softened his behaviour towards Barnaby from that moment Hugh laying his finger on his nose stepped back into his former place and they proceeded in silence It was between two and three o clock in the afternoon when the three great parties met at Westminster and uniting into one huge mass raised a tremendous shout This was not only done in token of their presence but as a signal to those on whom the task devolved that it was time to take possession of the lobbies of both Houses and of the various avenues of approach and of the gallery stairs To the last named place Hugh and Dennis still with their pupil between them rushed straightway Barnaby having given his flag into the hands of one of their own party who kept them at the outer door Their followers pressing on behind they were borne as on a great wave to the very doors of the gallery whence it was impossible to retreat even if they had been so inclined by reason of the throng which choked up the passages It is a familiar expression in describing a great crowd that a person might have walked upon the people s heads In this case it was actually done for a boy who had by some means got among the concourse and was in imminent danger of suffocation climbed to the shoulders of a man beside him and walked upon the people s hats and heads into the open street traversing in his passage the whole length of two staircases and a long gallery Nor was the swarm without less dense for a basket which had been tossed into the crowd was jerked from head to head and shoulder to shoulder and went spinning and whirling on above them until it was lost to view without ever once falling in among them or coming near the ground Through this vast throng sprinkled doubtless here and there with honest zealots but composed for the most part of the very scum and refuse of London whose growth was fostered by bad criminal laws bad prison regulations and the worst conceivable police such of the members of both Houses of Parliament as had not taken the precaution to be already at their posts were compelled to fight and force their way Their carriages were stopped and broken the wheels wrenched off the glasses shivered to atoms the panels beaten in drivers footmen and masters pulled from their seats and rolled in the mud Lords commoners and reverend bishops with little distinction of person or party were kicked and pinched and hustled passed from hand to hand through various stages of ill usage and sent to their fellow senators at last with their clothes hanging in ribands about them their bagwigs torn off themselves speechless and breathless and their persons covered with the powder which had been cuffed and beaten out of their hair One lord was so long in the hands of the populace that the Peers as a body resolved to sally forth and rescue him and were in the act of doing so when he happily appeared among them covered with dirt and bruises and hardly to be recognised by those who knew him best The noise and uproar were on the increase every moment The air was filled with execrations hoots and howlings The mob raged and roared like a mad monster as it was unceasingly and each new outrage served to swell its fury Within doors matters were even yet more threatening Lord George preceded by a man who carried the immense petition on a porter s knot through the lobby to the door of the House of Commons where it was received by two officers of the house who rolled it up to the table ready for presentation had taken his seat at an early hour before the Speaker went to prayers His followers pouring in at the same time the lobby and all the avenues were immediately filled as we have seen Thus the members were not only attacked in their passage through the streets but were set upon within the very walls of Parliament while the tumult both within and without was so great that those who attempted to speak could scarcely hear their own voices far less consult upon the course it would be wise to take in such extremity or animate each other to dignified and firm resistance So sure as any member just arrived with dress disordered and dishevelled hair came struggling through the crowd in the lobby it yelled and screamed in triumph and when the door of the House partially and cautiously opened by those within for his admission gave them a momentary glimpse of the interior they grew more wild and savage like beasts at the sight of prey and made a rush against the portal which strained its locks and bolts in their staples and shook the very beams The strangers gallery which was immediately above the door of the House had been ordered to be closed on the first rumour of disturbance and was empty save that now and then Lord George took his seat there for the convenience of coming to the head of the stairs which led to it and repeating to the people what had passed within It was on these stairs that Barnaby Hugh and Dennis were posted There were two flights short steep and narrow running parallel to each other and leading to two little doors communicating with a low passage which opened on the gallery Between them was a kind of well or unglazed skylight for the admission of light and air into the lobby which might be some eighteen or twenty feet below Upon one of these little staircases not that at the head of which Lord George appeared from time to time but the other Gashford stood with his elbow on the bannister and his cheek resting on his hand with his usual crafty aspect Whenever he varied this attitude in the slightest degree so much as by the gentlest motion of his arm the uproar was certain to increase not merely there but in the lobby below from which place no doubt some man who acted as fugleman to the rest was constantly looking up and watching him Order cried Hugh in a voice which made itself heard even above the roar and tumult as Lord George appeared at the top of the staircase News News from my lord The noise continued notwithstanding his appearance until Gashford looked round There was silence immediately even among the people in the passages without and on the other staircases who could neither see nor hear but to whom notwithstanding the signal was conveyed with marvellous rapidity Gentlemen said Lord George who was very pale and agitated we must be firm They talk of delays but we must have no delays They talk of taking your petition into consideration next Tuesday but we must have it considered now Present appearances look bad for our success but we must succeed and will We must succeed and will echoed the crowd And so among their shouts and cheers and other cries he bowed to them and retired and presently came back again There was another gesture from Gashford and a dead silence directly I am afraid he said this time that we have little reason gentlemen to hope for any redress from the proceedings of Parliament But we must redress our own grievances we must meet again we must put our trust in Providence and it will bless our endeavours This speech being a little more temperate than the last was not so favourably received When the noise and exasperation were at their height he came back once more and told them that the alarm had gone forth for many miles round that when the King heard of their assembling together in that great body he had no doubt His Majesty would send down private orders to have their wishes complied with and with the manner of his speech as childish irresolute and uncertain as his matter was proceeding in this strain when two gentlemen suddenly appeared at the door where he stood and pressing past him and coming a step or two lower down upon the stairs confronted the people The boldness of this action quite took them by surprise They were not the less disconcerted when one of the gentlemen turning to Lord George spoke thus in a loud voice that they might hear him well but quite coolly and collectedly You may tell these people if you please my lord that I am General Conway of whom they have heard and that I oppose this petition and all their proceedings and yours I am a soldier you may tell them and I will protect the freedom of this place with my sword You see my lord that the members of this House are all in arms to day you know that the entrance to it is a narrow one you cannot be ignorant that there are men within these walls who are determined to defend that pass to the last and before whom many lives must fall if your adherents persevere Have a care what you do And my Lord George said the other gentleman addressing him in like manner I desire them to hear this from me Colonel Gordon your near relation If a man among this crowd whose uproar strikes us deaf crosses the threshold of the House of Commons I swear to run my sword that moment not into his but into your body With that they stepped back again keeping their faces towards the crowd took each an arm of the misguided nobleman drew him into the passage and shut the door which they directly locked and fastened on the inside This was so quickly done and the demeanour of both gentlemen who were not young men either was so gallant and resolute that the crowd faltered and stared at each other with irresolute and timid looks Many tried to turn towards the door some of the faintest hearted cried they had best go back and called to those behind to give way and the panic and confusion were increasing rapidly when Gashford whispered Hugh What now Hugh roared aloud turning towards them Why go back Where can you do better than here boys One good rush against these doors and one below at the same time will do the business Rush on then As to the door below let those stand back who are afraid Let those who are not afraid try who shall be the first to pass it Here goes Look out down there Without the delay of an instant he threw himself headlong over the bannisters into the lobby below He had hardly touched the ground when Barnaby was at his side The chaplain s assistant and some members who were imploring the people to retire immediately withdrew and then with a great shout both crowds threw themselves against the doors pell mell and besieged the House in earnest At that moment when a second onset must have brought them into collision with those who stood on the defensive within in which case great loss of life and bloodshed would inevitably have ensued the hindmost portion of the crowd gave way and the rumour spread from mouth to mouth that a messenger had been despatched by water for the military who were forming in the street Fearful of sustaining a charge in the narrow passages in which they were so closely wedged together the throng poured out as impetuously as they had flocked in As the whole stream turned at once Barnaby and Hugh went with it and so fighting and struggling and trampling on fallen men and being trampled on in turn themselves they and the whole mass floated by degrees into the open street where a large detachment of the Guards both horse and foot came hurrying up clearing the ground before them so rapidly that the people seemed to melt away as they advanced The word of command to halt being given the soldiers formed across the street the rioters breathless and exhausted with their late exertions formed likewise though in a very irregular and disorderly manner The commanding officer rode hastily into the open space between the two bodies accompanied by a magistrate and an officer of the House of Commons for whose accommodation a couple of troopers had hastily dismounted The Riot Act was read but not a man stirred In the first rank of the insurgents Barnaby and Hugh stood side by side Somebody had thrust into Barnaby s hands when he came out into the street his precious flag which being now rolled up and tied round the pole looked like a giant quarter staff as he grasped it firmly and stood upon his guard If ever man believed with his whole heart and soul that he was engaged in a just cause and that he was bound to stand by his leader to the last poor Barnaby believed it of himself and Lord George Gordon After an ineffectual attempt to make himself heard the magistr e gave the word and the Horse Guards came riding in among the crowd But even then he galloped here and there exhorting the people to disperse and although heavy stones were thrown at the men and some were desperately cut and bruised they had no orders but to make prisoners of such of the rioters as were the most active and to drive the people back with the flat of their sabres As the horses came in among them the throng gave way at many points and the Guards following up their advantage were rapidly clearing the ground when two or three of the foremost who were in a manner cut off from the rest by the people closing round them made straight towards Barnaby and Hugh who had no doubt been pointed out as the two men who dropped into the lobby laying about them now with some effect and inflicting on the more turbulent of their opponents a few slight flesh wounds under the influence of which a man dropped here and there into the arms of his fellows amid much groaning and confusion At the sight of gashed and bloody faces seen for a moment in the crowd then hidden by the press around them Barnaby turned pale and sick But he stood his ground and grasping his pole more firmly yet kept his eye fixed upon the nearest soldier nodding his head meanwhile as Hugh with a scowling visage whispered in his ear The soldier came spurring on making his horse rear as the people pressed about him cutting at the hands of those who would have grasped his rein and forced his charger back and waving to his comrades to follow and still Barnaby without retreating an inch waited for his coming Some called to him to fly and some were in the very act of closing round him to prevent his being taken when the pole swept into the air above the people s heads and the man s saddle was empty in an instant Then he and Hugh turned and fled the crowd opening to let them pass and closing up again so quickly that there was no clue to the course they had taken Panting for breath hot dusty and exhausted with fatigue they reached the riverside in safety and getting into a boat with all despatch were soon out of any immediate danger As they glided down the river they plainly heard the people cheering and supposing they might have forced the soldiers to retreat lay upon their oars for a few minutes uncertain whether to return or not But the crowd passing along Westminster Bridge soon assured them that the populace were dispersing and Hugh rightly guessed from this that they had cheered the magistrate for offering to dismiss the military on condition of their immediate departure to their several homes and that he and Barnaby were better where they were He advised therefore that they should proceed to Blackfriars and going ashore at the bridge make the best of their way to The Boot where there was not only good entertainment and safe lodging but where they would certainly be joined by many of their late companions Barnaby assenting they decided on this course of action and pulled for Blackfriars accordingly They landed at a critical time and fortunately for themselves at the right moment For coming into Fleet Street they found it in an unusual stir and inquiring the cause were told that a body of Horse Guards had just galloped past and that they were escorting some rioters whom they had made prisoners to Newgate for safety Not at all ill pleased to have so narrowly escaped the cavalcade they lost no more time in asking questions but hurried to The Boot with as much speed as Hugh considered it prudent to make without appearing singular or attracting an inconvenient share of public notice Chapter 50 They were among the first to reach the tavern but they had not been there many minutes when several groups of men who had formed part of the crowd came straggling in Among them were Simon Tappertit and Mr Dennis both of whom but especially the latter greeted Barnaby with the utmost warmth and paid him many compliments on the prowess he had shown Which said Dennis with an oath as he rested his bludgeon in a corner with his hat upon it and took his seat at the same table with them it does me good to think of There was a opportunity But it led to nothing For my part I don t know what would There s no spirit among the people in these here times Bring something to eat and drink here I m disgusted with humanity On what account asked Mr Tappertit who had been quenching his fiery face in a half gallon can Don t you consider this a good beginning mister Give me security that it an t a ending rejoined the hangman When that soldier went down we might have made London ours but no we stand and gape and look on the justice I wish he had had a bullet in each eye as he would have had if we d gone to work my way says My lads if you ll give me your word to disperse I ll order off the military our people sets up a hurrah throws up the game with the winning cards in their hands and skulks away like a pack of tame curs as they are Ah said the hangman in a tone of deep disgust it makes me blush for my feller creeturs I wish I had been born a ox I do You d have been quite as agreeable a character if you had been I think returned Simon Tappertit going out in a lofty manner Don t be too sure of that rejoined the hangman calling after him if I was a horned animal at the present moment with the smallest grain of sense I d toss every man in this company excepting them two meaning Hugh and Barnaby for his manner of conducting himself this day With which mournful review of their proceedings Mr Dennis sought consolation in cold boiled beef and beer but without at all relaxing the grim and dissatisfied expression of his face the gloom of which was rather deepened than dissipated by their grateful influence The company who were thus libelled might have retaliated by strong words if not by blows but they were dispirited and worn out The greater part of them had fasted since morning all had suffered extremely from the excessive heat and between the day s shouting exertion and excitement many had quite lost their voices and so much of their strength that they could hardly stand Then they were uncertain what to do next fearful of the consequences of what they had done already and sensible that after all they had carried no point but had indeed left matters worse than they had found them Of those who had come to The Boot many dropped off within an hour such of them as were really honest and sincere never after the morning s experience to return or to hold any communication with their late companions Others remained but to refresh themselves and then went home desponding others who had theretofore been regular in their attendance avoided the place altogether The half dozen prisoners whom the Guards had taken were magnified by report into half a hundred at least and their friends being faint and sober so slackened in their energy and so drooped beneath these dispiriting influences that by eight o clock in the evening Dennis Hugh and Barnaby were left alone Even they were fast asleep upon the benches when Gashford s entrance roused them Oh you ARE here then said the Secretary Dear me Why where should we be Muster Gashford Dennis rejoined as he rose into a sitting posture Oh nowhere nowhere he returned with excessive mildness The streets are filled with blue cockades I rather thought you might have been among them I am glad you are not You have orders for us master then said Hugh Oh dear no Not I No orders my good fellow What orders should I have You are not in my service Muster Gashford remonstrated Dennis we belong to the cause don t we The cause repeated the secretary looking at him in a sort of abstraction There is no cause The cause is lost Lost Oh yes You have heard I suppose The petition is rejected by a hundred and ninety two to six It s quite final We might have spared ourselves some trouble That and my lord s vexation are the only circumstances I regret I am quite satisfied in all other respects As he said this he took a penknife from his pocket and putting his hat upon his knee began to busy himself in ripping off the blue cockade which he had worn all day at the same time humming a psalm tune which had been very popular in the morning and dwelling on it with a gentle regret His two adherents looked at each other and at him as if they were at a loss how to pursue the subject At length Hugh after some elbowing and winking between himself and Mr Dennis ventured to stay his hand and to ask him why he meddled with that riband in his hat Because said the secretary looking up with something between a snarl and a smile because to sit still and wear it or to fall asleep and wear it is a mockery That s all friend What would you have us do master cried Hugh Nothing returned Gashford shrugging his shoulders nothing When my lord was reproached and threatened for standing by you I as a prudent man would have had you do nothing When the soldiers were trampling you under their horses feet I would have had you do nothing When one of them was struck down by a daring hand and I saw confusion and dismay in all their faces I would have had you do nothing just what you did in short This is the young man who had so little prudence and so much boldness Ah I am sorry for him Sorry master cried Hugh Sorry Muster Gashford echoed Dennis In case there should be a proclamation out to morrow offering five hundred pounds or some such trifle for his apprehension and in case it should include another man who dropped into the lobby from the stairs above said Gashford coldly still do nothing Fire and fury master cried Hugh starting up What have we done that you should talk to us like this Nothing returned Gashford with a sneer If you are cast into prison if the young man here he looked hard at Barnaby s attentive face is dragged from us and from his friends perhaps from people whom he loves and whom his death would kill is thrown into jail brought out and hanged before their eyes still do nothing You ll find it your best policy I have no doubt Come on cried Hugh striding towards the door Dennis Barnaby come on Where To do what said Gashford slipping past him and standing with his back against it Anywhere Anything cried Hugh Stand aside master or the window will serve our turn as well Let us out Ha ha ha You are of such of such an impetuous nature said Gashford changing his manner for one of the utmost good fellowship and the pleasantest raillery you are such an excitable creature but you ll drink with me before you go Oh yes certainly growled Dennis drawing his sleeve across his thirsty lips No malice brother Drink with Muster Gashford Hugh wiped his heated brow and relaxed into a smile The artful secretary laughed outright Some liquor here Be quick or he ll not stop even for that He is a man of such desperate ardour said the smooth secretary whom Mr Dennis corroborated with sundry nods and muttered oaths Once roused he is a fellow of such fierce determination Hugh poised his sturdy arm aloft and clapping Barnaby on the back bade him fear nothing They shook hands together poor Barnaby evidently possessed with the idea that he was among the most virtuous and disinterested heroes in the world and Gashford laughed again I hear he said smoothly as he stood among them with a great measure of liquor in his hand and filled their glasses as quickly and as often as they chose I hear but I cannot say whether it be true or false that the men who are loitering in the streets to night are half disposed to pull down a Romish chapel or two and that they only want leaders I even heard mention of those in Duke Street Lincoln s Inn Fields and in Warwick Street Golden Square but common report you know You are not going To do nothing rnaster eh cried Hugh No jails and halter for Barnaby and me They must be frightened out of that Leaders are wanted are they Now boys A most impetuous fellow cried the secretary Ha ha A courageous boisterous most vehement fellow A man who There was no need to finish the sentence for they had rushed out of the house and were far beyond hearing He stopped in the middle of a laugh listened drew on his gloves and clasping his hands behind him paced the deserted room for a long time then bent his steps towards the busy town and walked into the streets They were filled with people for the rumour of that day s proceedings had made a great noise Those persons who did not care to leave home were at their doors or windows and one topic of discourse prevailed on every side Some reported that the riots were effectually put down others that they had broken out again some said that Lord George Gordon had been sent under a strong guard to the Tower others that an attempt had been made upon the King s life that the soldiers had been again called out and that the noise of musketry in a distant part of the town had been plainly heard within an hour As it grew darker these stories became more direful and mysterious and often when some frightened passenger ran past with tidings that the rioters were not far off and were coming up the doors were shut and barred lower windows made secure and as much consternation engendered as if the city were invaded by a foreign army Gashford walked stealthily about listening to all he heard and diffusing or confirming whenever he had an opportunity such false intelligence as suited his own purpose and busily occupied in this way turned into Holborn for the twentieth time when a great many women and children came flying along the street often panting and looking back and the confused murmur of numerous voices struck upon his ear Assured by these tokens and by the red light which began to flash upon the houses on either side that some of his friends were indeed approaching he begged a moment s shelter at a door which opened as he passed and running with some other persons to an upper window looked out upon the crowd They had torches among them and the chief faces were distinctly visible That they had been engaged in the destruction of some building was sufficiently apparent and that it was a Catholic place of worship was evident from the spoils they bore as trophies which were easily recognisable for the vestments of priests and rich fragments of altar furniture Covered with soot and dirt and dust and lime their garments torn to rags their hair hanging wildly about them their hands and faces jagged and bleeding with the wounds of rusty nails Barnaby Hugh and Dennis hurried on before them all like hideous madmen After them the dense throng came fighting on some singing some shouting in triumph some quarrelling among themselves some menacing the spectators as they passed some with great wooden fragments on which they spent their rage as if they had been alive rending them limb from limb and hurling the scattered morsels high into the air some in a drunken state unconscious of the hurts they had received from falling bricks and stones and beams one borne upon a shutter in the very midst covered with a dingy cloth a senseless ghastly heap Thus a vision of coarse faces with here and there a blot of flaring smoky light a dream of demon heads and savage eyes and sticks and iron bars uplifted in the air and whirled about a bewildering horror in which so much was seen and yet so little which seemed so long and yet so short in which there were so many phantoms not to be forgotten all through life and yet so many things that could not be observed in one distracting glimpse it flitted onward and was gone As it passed away upon its work of wrath and ruin a piercing scream was heard A knot of persons ran towards the spot Gashford who just then emerged into the street among them He was on the outskirts of the little concourse and could not see or hear what passed within but one who had a better place informed him that a widow woman had descried her son among the rioters Is that all said the secretary turning his face homewards Well I think this looks a little more like business Chapter 51 Promising as these outrages were to Gashford s view and much like business as they looked they extended that night no farther The soldiers were again called out again they took half a dozen prisoners and again the crowd dispersed after a short and bloodless scuffle Hot and drunken though they were they had not yet broken all bounds and set all law and government at defiance Something of their habitual deference to the authority erected by society for its own preservation yet remained among them and had its majesty been vindicated in time the secretary would have had to digest a bitter disappointment By midnight the streets were clear and quiet and save that there stood in two parts of the town a heap of nodding walls and pile of rubbish where there had been at sunset a rich and handsome building everything wore its usual aspect Even the Catholic gentry and tradesmen of whom there were many resident in different parts of the City and its suburbs had no fear for their lives or property and but little indignation for the wrong they had already sustained in the plunder and destruction of their temples of worship An honest confidence in the government under whose protection they had lived for many years and a well founded reliance on the good feeling and right thinking of the great mass of the community with whom notwithstanding their religious differences they were every day in habits of confidential affectionate and friendly intercourse reassured them even under the excesses that had been committed and convinced them that they who were Protestants in anything but the name were no more to be considered as abettors of these disgraceful occurrences than they themselves were chargeable with the uses of the block the rack the gibbet and the stake in cruel Mary s reign The clock was on the stroke of one when Gabriel Varden with his lady and Miss Miggs sat waiting in the little parlour This fact the toppling wicks of the dull wasted candles the silence that prevailed and above all the nightcaps of both maid and matron were sufficient evidence that they had been prepared for bed some time ago and had some reason for sitting up so far beyond their usual hour If any other corroborative testimony had been required it would have been abundantly furnished in the actions of Miss Miggs who having arrived at that restless state and sensitive condition of the nervous system which are the result of long watching did by a constant rubbing and tweaking of her nose a perpetual change of position arising from the sudden growth of imaginary knots and knobs in her chair a frequent friction of her eyebrows the incessant recurrence of a small cough a small groan a gasp a sigh a sniff a spasmodic start and by other demonstrations of that nature so file down and rasp as it were the patience of the locksmith that after looking at her in silence for some time he at last broke out into this apostrophe Miggs my good girl go to bed do go to bed You re really worse than the dripping of a hundred water butts outside the window or the scratching of as many mice behind the wainscot I can t bear it Do go to bed Miggs To oblige me do You haven t got nothing to untie sir returned Miss Miggs and therefore your requests does not surprise me But missis has and while you sit up mim she added turning to the locksmith s wife I couldn t no not if twenty times the quantity of cold water was aperiently running down my back at this moment go to bed with a quiet spirit Having spoken these words Miss Miggs made divers efforts to rub her shoulders in an impossible place and shivered from head to foot thereby giving the beholders to understand that the imaginary cascade was still in full flow but that a sense of duty upheld her under that and all other sufferings and nerved her to endurance Mrs Varden being too sleepy to speak and Miss Miggs having as the phrase is said her say the locksmith had nothing for it but to sigh and be as quiet as he could But to be quiet with such a basilisk before him was impossible If he looked another way it was worse to feel that she was rubbing her cheek or twitching her ear or winking her eye or making all kinds of extraordinary shapes with her nose than to see her do it If she was for a moment free from any of these complaints it was only because of her foot being asleep or of her arm having got the fidgets or of her leg being doubled up with the cramp or of some other horrible disorder which racked her whole frame If she did enjoy a moment s ease then with her eyes shut and her mouth wide open she would be seen to sit very stiff and upright in her chair then to nod a little way forward and stop with a jerk then to nod a little farther forward and stop with another jerk then to recover herself then to come forward again lower lower lower by very slow degrees until just as it seemed impossible that she could preserve her balance for another instant and the locksmith was about to call out in an agony to save her from dashing down upon her forehead and fracturing her skull then all of a sudden and without the smallest notice she would come upright and rigid again with her eyes open and in her countenance an expression of defiance sleepy but yet most obstinate which plainly said I ve never once closed em since I looked at you last and I ll take my oath of it At length after the clock had struck two there was a sound at the street door as if somebody had fallen against the knocker by accident Miss Miggs immediately jumping up and clapping her hands cried with a drowsy mingling of the sacred and profane Ally Looyer mim there s Simmuns s knock Who s there said Gabriel Me cried the well known voice of Mr Tappertit Gabriel opened the door and gave him admission He did not cut a very insinuating figure for a man of his stature suffers in a crowd and having been active in yesterday morning s work his dress was literally crushed from head to foot his hat being beaten out of all shape and his shoes trodden down at heel like slippers His coat fluttered in strips about him the buckles were torn away both from his knees and feet half his neckerchief was gone and the bosom of his shirt was rent to tatters Yet notwithstanding all these personal disadvantages despite his being very weak from heat and fatigue and so begrimed with mud and dust that he might have been in a case for anything of the real texture either of his skin or apparel that the eye could discern he stalked haughtily into the parlour and throwing himself into a chair and endeavouring to thrust his hands into the pockets of his small clothes which were turned inside out and displayed upon his legs like tassels surveyed the household with a gloomy dignity Simon said the locksmith gravely how comes it that you return home at this time of night and in this condition Give me an assurance that you have not been among the rioters and I am satisfied Sir replied Mr Tappertit with a contemptuous look I wonder at YOUR assurance in making such demands You have been drinking said the locksmith As a general principle and in the most offensive sense of the words sir returned his journeyman with great self possession I consider you a liar In that last observation you have unintentionally unintentionally sir struck upon the truth Martha said the locksmith turning to his wife and shaking his head sorrowfully while a smile at the absurd figure beside him still played upon his open face I trust it may turn out that this poor lad is not the victim of the knaves and fools we have so often had words about and who have done so much harm to day If he has been at Warwick Street or Duke Street to night He has been at neither sir cried Mr Tappertit in a loud voice which he suddenly dropped into a whisper as he repeated with eyes fixed upon the locksmith he has been at neither I am glad of it with all my heart said the locksmith in a serious tone for if he had been and it could be proved against him Martha your Great Association would have been to him the cart that draws men to the gallows and leaves them hanging in the air It would as sure as we re alive Mrs Varden was too much scared by Simon s altered manner and appearance and by the accounts of the rioters which had reached her ears that night to offer any retort or to have recourse to her usual matrimonial policy Miss Miggs wrung her hands and wept He was not at Duke Street or at Warwick Street G Varden said Simon sternly but he WAS at Westminster Perhaps sir he kicked a county member perhaps sir he tapped a lord you may stare sir I repeat it blood flowed from noses and perhaps he tapped a lord Who knows This he added putting his hand into his waistcoat pocket and taking out a large tooth at the sight of which both Miggs and Mrs Varden screamed this was a bishop s Beware G Varden Now I would rather said the locksmith hastily have paid five hundred pounds than had this come to pass You idiot do you know what peril you stand in I know it sir replied his journeyman and it is my glory I was there everybody saw me there I was conspicuous and prominent I will abide the consequences The locksmith really disturbed and agitated paced to and fro in silence glancing at his former prentice every now and then and at length stopping before him said Get to bed and sleep for a couple of hours that you may wake penitent and with some of your senses about you Be sorry for what you have done and we will try to save you If I call him by five o clock said Varden turning hurriedly to his wife and he washes himself clean and changes his dress he may get to the Tower Stairs and away by the Gravesend tide boat before any search is made for him From there he can easily get on to Canterbury where your cousin will give him work till this storm has blown over I am not sure that I do right in screening him from the punishment he deserves but he has lived in this house man and boy for a dozen years and I should be sorry if for this one day s work he made a miserable end Lock the front door Miggs and show no light towards the street when you go upstairs Quick Simon Get to bed And do you suppose sir retorted Mr Tappertit with a thickness and slowness of speech which contrasted forcibly with the rapidity and earnestness of his kind hearted master and do you suppose sir that I am base and mean enough to accept your servile proposition Miscreant Whatever you please Sim but get to bed Every minute is of consequence The light here Miggs Yes yes oh do Go to bed directly cried the two women together Mr Tappertit stood upon his feet and pushing his chair away to show that he needed no assistance answered swaying himself to and fro and managing his head as if it had no connection whatever with his body You spoke of Miggs sir Miggs may be smothered Oh Simmun ejaculated that young lady in a faint voice Oh mim Oh sir Oh goodness gracious what a turn he has give me This family may ALL be smothered sir returned Mr Tappertit after glancing at her with a smile of ineffable disdain excepting Mrs V I have come here sir for her sake this night Mrs Varden take this piece of paper It s a protection ma am You may need it With these words he held out at arm s length a dirty crumpled scrap of writing The locksmith took it from him opened it and read as follows All good friends to our cause I hope will be particular and do no injury to the property of any true Protestant I am well assured that the proprietor of this house is a staunch and worthy friend to the cause GEORGE GORDON What s this said the locksmith with an altered face Something that ll do you good service young feller replied his journeyman as you ll find Keep that safe and where you can lay your hand upon it in an instant And chalk No Popery on your door to morrow night and for a week to come that s all This is a genuine document said the locksmith I know for I have seen the hand before What threat does it imply What devil is abroad A fiery devil retorted Sim a flaming furious devil Don t you put yourself in its way or you re done for my buck Be warned in time G Varden Farewell But here the two women threw themselves in his way especially Miss Miggs who fell upon him with such fervour that she pinned him against the wall and conjured him in moving words not to go forth till he was sober to listen to reason to think of it to take some rest and then determine I tell you said Mr Tappertit that my mind is made up My bleeding country calls me and I go Miggs if you don t get out of the way I ll pinch you Miss Miggs still clinging to the rebel screamed once vociferously but whether in the distraction of her mind or because of his having executed his threat is uncertain Release me said Simon struggling to free himself from her chaste but spider like embrace Let me go I have made arrangements for you in an altered state of society and mean to provide for you comfortably in life there Will that satisfy you Oh Simmun cried Miss Miggs Oh my blessed Simmun Oh mim what are my feelings at this conflicting moment Of a rather turbulent description it would seem for her nightcap had been knocked off in the scuffle and she was on her knees upon the floor making a strange revelation of blue and yellow curl papers straggling locks of hair tags of staylaces and strings of it s impossible to say what panting for breath clasping her hands turning her eyes upwards shedding abundance of tears and exhibiting various other symptoms of the acutest mental suffering I leave said Simon turning to his master with an utter disregard of Miggs s maidenly affliction a box of things upstairs Do what you like with em I don t want em I m never coming back here any more Provide yourself sir with a journeyman I m my country s journeyman henceforward that s MY line of business Be what you like in two hours time but now go up to bed returned the locksmith planting himself in the doorway Do you hear me Go to bed I hear you and defy you Varden rejoined Simon Tappertit This night sir I have been in the country planning an expedition which shall fill your bell hanging soul with wonder and dismay The plot demands my utmost energy Let me pass I ll knock you down if you come near the door replied the locksmith You had better go to bed Simon made no answer but gathering himself up as straight as he could plunged head foremost at his old master and the two went driving out into the workshop together plying their hands and feet so briskly that they looked like half a dozen while Miggs and Mrs Varden screamed for twelve It would have been easy for Varden to knock his old prentice down and bind him hand and foot but as he was loth to hurt him in his then defenceless state he contented himself with parrying his blows when he could taking them in perfect good part when he could not and keeping between him and the door until a favourable opportunity should present itself for forcing him to retreat up stairs and shutting him up in his own room But in the goodness of his heart he calculated too much upon his adversary s weakness and forgot that drunken men who have lost the power of walking steadily can often run Watching his time Simon Tappertit made a cunning show of falling back staggered unexpectedly forward brushed past him opened the door he knew the trick of that lock well and darted down the street like a mad dog The locksmith paused for a moment in the excess of his astonishment and then gave chase It was an excellent season for a run for at that silent hour the streets were deserted the air was cool and the flying figure before him distinctly visible at a great distance as it sped away with a long gaunt shadow following at its heels But the short winded locksmith had no chance against a man of Sim s youth and spare figure though the day had been when he could have run him down in no time The space between them rapidly increased and as the rays of the rising sun streamed upon Simon in the act of turning a distant corner Gabriel Varden was fain to give up and sit down on a doorstep to fetch his breath Simon meanwhile without once stopping fled at the same degree of swiftness to The Boot where as he well knew some of his company were lying and at which respectable hostelry for he had already acquired the distinction of being in great peril of the law a friendly watch had been expecting him all night and was even now on the look out for his coming Go thy ways Sim go thy ways said the locksmith as soon as he could speak I have done my best for thee poor lad and would have saved thee but the rope is round thy neck I fear So saying and shaking his head in a very sorrowful and disconsolate manner he turned back and soon re entered his own house where Mrs Varden and the faithful Miggs had been anxiously expecting his return Now Mrs Varden and by consequence Miss Miggs likewise was impressed with a secret misgiving that she had done wrong that she had to the utmost of her small means aided and abetted the growth of disturbances the end of which it was impossible to foresee that she had led remotely to the scene which had just passed and that the locksmith s time for triumph and reproach had now arrived indeed And so strongly did Mrs Varden feel this and so crestfallen was she in consequence that while her husband was pursuing their lost journeyman she secreted under her chair the little red brick dwelling house with the yellow roof lest it should furnish new occasion for reference to the painful theme and now hid the same still more with the skirts of her dress But it happened that the locksmith had been thinking of this very article on his way home and that coming into the room and not seeing it he at once demanded where it was Mrs Varden had no resource but to produce it which she did with many tears and broken protestations that if she could have known Yes yes said Varden of course I know that I don t mean to reproach you my dear But recollect from this time that all good things perverted to evil purposes are worse than those which are naturally bad A thoroughly wicked woman is wicked indeed When religion goes wrong she is very wrong for the same reason Let us say no more about it my dear So he dropped the red brick dwelling house on the floor and setting his heel upon it crushed it into pieces The halfpence and sixpences and other voluntary contributions rolled about in all directions but nobody offered to touch them or to take them up That said the locksmith is easily disposed of and I would to Heaven that everything growing out of the same society could be settled as easily It happens very fortunately Varden said his wife with her handkerchief to her eyes that in case any more disturbances should happen which I hope not I sincerely hope not I hope so too my dear That in case any should occur we have the piece of paper which that poor misguided young man brought Ay to be sure said the locksmith turning quickly round Where is that piece of paper Mrs Varden stood aghast as he took it from her outstretched band tore it into fragments and threw them under the grate Not use it she said Use it cried the locksmith No Let them come and pull the roof about our ears let them burn us out of house and home I d neither have the protection of their leader nor chalk their howl upon my door though for not doing it they shot me on my own threshold Use it Let them come and do their worst The first man who crosses my doorstep on such an errand as theirs had better be a hundred miles away Let him look to it The others may have their will I wouldn t beg or buy them off if instead of every pound of iron in the place there was a hundred weight of gold Get you to bed Martha I shall take down the shutters and go to work So early said his wife Ay replied the locksmith cheerily so early Come when they may they shall not find us skulking and hiding as if we feared to take our portion of the light of day and left it all to them So pleasant dreams to you my dear and cheerful sleep With that he gave his wife a hearty kiss and bade her delay no longer or it would be time to rise before she lay down to rest Mrs Varden quite amiably and meekly walked upstairs followed by Miggs who although a good deal subdued could not refrain from sundry stimulative coughs and sniffs by the way or from holding up her hands in astonishment at the daring conduct of master Chapter 52 A mob is usually a creature of very mysterious existence particularly in a large city Where it comes from or whither it goes few men can tell Assembling and dispersing with equal suddenness it is as difficult to follow to its various sources as the sea itself nor does the parallel stop here for the ocean is not more fickle and uncertain more terrible when roused more unreasonable or more cruel The people who were boisterous at Westminster upon the Friday morning and were eagerly bent upon the work of devastation in Duke Street and Warwick Street at night were in the mass the same Allowing for the chance accessions of which any crowd is morally sure in a town where there must always be a large number of idle and profligate persons one and the same mob was at both places Yet they spread themselves in various directions when they dispersed in the afternoon made no appointment for reassembling had no definite purpose or design and indeed for anything they knew were scattered beyond the hope of future union At The Boot which as has been shown was in a manner the head quarters of the rioters there were not upon this Friday night a dozen people Some slept in the stable and outhouses some in the common room some two or three in beds The rest were in their usual homes or haunts Perhaps not a score in all lay in the adjacent fields and lanes and under haystacks or near the warmth of brick kilns who had not their accustomed place of rest beneath the open sky As to the public ways within the town they had their ordinary nightly occupants and no others the usual amount of vice and wretchedness but no more The experience of one evening however had taught the reckless leaders of disturbance that they had but to show themselves in the streets to be immediately surrounded by materials which they could only have kept together when their aid was not required at great risk expense and trouble Once possessed of this secret they were as confident as if twenty thousand men devoted to their will had been encamped about them and assumed a confidence which could not have been surpassed though that had really been the case All day Saturday they remained quiet On Sunday they rather studied how to keep their men within call and in full hope than to follow out by any fierce measure their first day s proceedings I hope said Dennis as with a loud yawn he raised his body from a heap of straw on which he had been sleeping and supporting his head upon his hand appealed to Hugh on Sunday morning that Muster Gashford allows some rest Perhaps he d have us at work again already eh It s not his way to let matters drop you may be sure of that growled Hugh in answer I m in no humour to stir yet though I m as stiff as a dead body and as full of ugly scratches as if I had been fighting all day yesterday with wild cats You ve so much enthusiasm that s it said Dennis looking with great admiration at the uncombed head matted beard and torn hands and face of the wild figure before him you re such a devil of a fellow You hurt yourself a hundred times more than you need because you will be foremost in everything and will do more than the rest For the matter of that returned Hugh shaking back his ragged hair and glancing towards the door of the stable in which they lay there s one yonder as good as me What did I tell you about him Did I say he was worth a dozen when you doubted him Mr Dennis rolled lazily over upon his breast and resting his chin upon his hand in imitation of the attitude in which Hugh lay said as he too looked towards the door Ay ay you knew him brother you knew him But who d suppose to look at that chap now that he could be the man he is Isn t it a thousand cruel pities brother that instead of taking his nat ral rest and qualifying himself for further exertions in this here honourable cause he should be playing at soldiers like a boy And his cleanliness too said Mr Dennis who certainly had no reason to entertain a fellow feeling with anybody who was particular on that score what weaknesses he s guilty of with respect to his cleanliness At five o clock this morning there he was at the pump though any one would think he had gone through enough the day before yesterday to be pretty fast asleep at that time But no when I woke for a minute or two there he was at the pump and if you d seen him sticking them peacock s feathers into his hat when he d done washing ah I m sorry he s such a imperfect character but the best on us is incomplete in some pint of view or another The subject of this dialogue and of these concluding remarks which were uttered in a tone of philosophical meditation was as the reader will have divined no other than Barnaby who with his flag in hand stood sentry in the little patch of sunlight at the distant door or walked to and fro outside singing softly to himself and keeping time to the music of some clear church bells Whether he stood still leaning with both hands on the flagstaff or bearing it upon his shoulder paced slowly up and down the careful arrangement of his poor dress and his erect and lofty bearing showed how high a sense he had of the great importance of his trust and how happy and how proud it made him To Hugh and his companion who lay in a dark corner of the gloomy shed he and the sunlight and the peaceful Sabbath sound to which he made response seemed like a bright picture framed by the door and set off by the stable s blackness The whole formed such a contrast to themselves as they lay wallowing like some obscene animals in their squalor and wickedness on the two heaps of straw that for a few moments they looked on without speaking and felt almost ashamed Ah said Hugh at length carrying it off with a laugh He s a rare fellow is Barnaby and can do more with less rest or meat or drink than any of us As to his soldiering I put him on duty there Then there was a object in it and a proper good one too I ll be sworn retorted Dennis with a broad grin and an oath of the same quality What was it brother Why you see said Hugh crawling a little nearer to him that our noble captain yonder came in yesterday morning rather the worse for liquor and was like you and me ditto last night Dennis looked to where Simon Tappertit lay coiled upon a truss of hay snoring profoundly and nodded And our noble captain continued Hugh with another laugh our noble captain and I have planned for to morrow a roaring expedition with good profit in it Again the Papists asked Dennis rubbing his hands Ay against the Papists against one of em at least that some of us and I for one owe a good heavy grudge to Not Muster Gashford s friend that he spoke to us about in my house eh said Dennis brimfull of pleasant expectation The same man said Hugh That s your sort cried Mr Dennis gaily shaking hands with him that s the kind of game Let s have revenges and injuries and all that and we shall get on twice as fast Now you talk indeed Ha ha ha The captain added Hugh has thoughts of carrying off a woman in the bustle and ha ha ha and so have I Mr Dennis received this part of the scheme with a wry face observing that as a general principle he objected to women altogether as being unsafe and slippery persons on whom there was no calculating with any certainty and who were never in the same mind for four and twenty hours at a stretch He might have expatiated on this suggestive theme at much greater length but that it occurred to him to ask what connection existed between the proposed expedition and Barnaby s being posted at the stable door as sentry to which Hugh cautiously replied in these words Why the people we mean to visit were friends of his once upon a time and I know that much of him to feel pretty sure that if he thought we were going to do them any harm he d be no friend to our side but would lend a ready hand to the other So I ve persuaded him for I know him of old that Lord George has picked him out to guard this place to morrow while we re away and that it s a great honour and so he s on duty now and as proud of it as if he was a general Ha ha What do you say to me for a careful man as well as a devil of a one Mr Dennis exhausted himself in compliments and then added But about the expedition itself About that said Hugh you shall hear all particulars from me and the great captain conjointly and both together for see he s waking up Rouse yourself lion heart Ha ha Put a good face upon it and drink again Another hair of the dog that bit you captain Call for drink There s enough of gold and silver cups and candlesticks buried underneath my bed he added rolling back the straw and pointing to where the ground was newly turned to pay for it if it was a score of casks full Drink captain Mr Tappertit received these jovial promptings with a very bad grace being much the worse both in mind and body for his two nights of debauch and but indifferently able to stand upon his legs With Hugh s assistance however he contrived to stagger to the pump and having refreshed himself with an abundant draught of cold water and a copious shower of the same refreshing liquid on his head and face he ordered some rum and milk to be served and upon that innocent beverage and some biscuits and cheese made a pretty hearty meal That done he disposed himself in an easy attitude on the ground beside his two companions who were carousing after their own tastes and proceeded to enlighten Mr Dennis in reference to to morrow s project That their conversation was an interesting one was rendered manifest by its length and by the close attention of all three That it was not of an oppressively grave character but was enlivened by various pleasantries arising out of the subject was clear from their loud and frequent roars of laughter which startled Barnaby on his post and made him wonder at their levity But he was not summoned to join them until they had eaten and drunk and slept and talked together for some hours not indeed until the twilight when they informed him that they were about to make a slight demonstration in the streets just to keep the people s hands in as it was Sunday night and the public might otherwise be disappointed and that he was free to accompany them if he would Without the slightest preparation saving that they carried clubs and wore the blue cockade they sallied out into the streets and with no more settled design than that of doing as much mischief as they could paraded them at random Their numbers rapidly increasing they soon divided into parties and agreeing to meet by and by in the fields near Welbeck Street scoured the town in various directions The largest body and that which augmented with the greatest rapidity was the one to which Hugh and Barnaby belonged This took its way towards Moorfields where there was a rich chapel and in which neighbourhood several Catholic families were known to reside Beginning with the private houses so occupied they broke open the doors and windows and while they destroyed the furniture and left but the bare walls made a sharp search for tools and engines of destruction such as hammers pokers axes saws and such like instruments Many of the rioters made belts of cord of handkerchiefs or any material they found at hand and wore these weapons as openly as pioneers upon a field day There was not the least disguise or concealment indeed on this night very little excitement or hurry From the chapels they tore down and took away the very altars benches pulpits pews and flooring from the dwelling houses the very wainscoting and stairs This Sunday evening s recreation they pursued like mere workmen who had a certain task to do and did it Fifty resolute men might have turned them at any moment a single company of soldiers could have scattered them like dust but no man interposed no authority restrained them and except by the terrified persons who fled from their approach they were as little heeded as if they were pursuing their lawful occupations with the utmost sobriety and good conduct In the same manner they marched to the place of rendezvous agreed upon made great fires in the fields and reserving the most valuable of their spoils burnt the rest Priestly garments images of saints rich stuffs and ornaments altar furniture and household goods were cast into the flames and shed a glare on the whole country round but they danced and howled and roared about these fires till they were tired and were never for an instant checked As the main body filed off from this scene of action and passed down Welbeck Street they came upon Gashford who had been a witness of their proceedings and was walking stealthily along the pavement Keeping up with him and yet not seeming to speak Hugh muttered in his ear Is this better master No said Gashford It is not What would you have said Hugh Fevers are never at their height at once They must get on by degrees I would have you said Gashford pinching his arm with such malevolence that his nails seemed to meet in the skin I would have you put some meaning into your work Fools Can you make no better bonfires than of rags and scraps Can you burn nothing whole A little patience master said Hugh Wait but a few hours and you shall see Look for a redness in the sky to morrow night With that he fell back into his place beside Barnaby and when the secretary looked after him both were lost in the crowd Chapter 53 The next day was ushered in by merry peals of bells and by the firing of the Tower guns flags were hoisted on many of the church steeples the usual demonstrations were made in honour of the anniversary of the King s birthday and every man went about his pleasure or business as if the city were in perfect order and there were no half smouldering embers in its secret places which on the approach of night would kindle up again and scatter ruin and dismay abroad The leaders of the riot rendered still more daring by the success of last night and by the booty they had acquired kept steadily together and only thought of implicating the mass of their followers so deeply that no hope of pardon or reward might tempt them to betray their more notorious confederates into the hands of justice Indeed the sense of having gone too far to be forgiven held the timid together no less than the bold Many who would readily have pointed out the foremost rioters and given evidence against them felt that escape by that means was hopeless when their every act had been observed by scores of people who had taken no part in the disturbances who had suffered in their persons peace or property by the outrages of the mob who would be most willing witnesses and whom the government would no doubt prefer to any King s evidence that might be offered Many of this class had deserted their usual occupations on the Saturday morning some had been seen by their employers active in the tumult others knew they must be suspected and that they would be discharged if they returned others had been desperate from the beginning and comforted themselves with the homely proverb that being hanged at all they might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb They all hoped and believed in a greater or less degree that the government they seemed to have paralysed would in its terror come to terms with them in the end and suffer them to make their own conditions The least sanguine among them reasoned with himself that at the worst they were too many to be all punished and that he had as good a chance of escape as any other man The great mass never reasoned or thought at all but were stimulated by their own headlong passions by poverty by ignorance by the love of mischief and the hope of plunder One other circumstance is worthy of remark and that is that from the moment of their first outbreak at Westminster every symptom of order or preconcerted arrangement among them vanished When they divided into parties and ran to different quarters of the town it was on the spontaneous suggestion of the moment Each party swelled as it went along like rivers as they roll towards the sea new leaders sprang up as they were wanted disappeared when the necessity was over and reappeared at the next crisis Each tumult took shape and form from the circumstances of the moment sober workmen going home from their day s labour were seen to cast down their baskets of tools and become rioters in an instant mere boys on errands did the like In a word a moral plague ran through the city The noise and hurry and excitement had for hundreds and hundreds an attraction they had no firmness to resist The contagion spread like a dread fever an infectious madness as yet not near its height seized on new victims every hour and society began to tremble at their ravings It was between two and three o clock in the afternoon when Gashford looked into the lair described in the last chapter and seeing only Barnaby and Dennis there inquired for Hugh He was out Barnaby told him had gone out more than an hour ago and had not yet returned Dennis said the smiling secretary in his smoothest voice as he sat down cross legged on a barrel Dennis The hangman struggled into a sitting posture directly and with his eyes wide open looked towards him How do you do Dennis said Gashford nodding I hope you have suffered no inconvenience from your late exertions Dennis I always will say of you Muster Gashford returned the hangman staring at him that that ere quiet way of yours might almost wake a dead man It is he added with a muttered oath still staring at him in a thoughtful manner so awful sly So distinct eh Dennis Distinct he answered scratching his head and keeping his eyes upon the secretary s face I seem to hear it Muster Gashford in my wery bones I am very glad your sense of hearing is so sharp and that I succeed in making myself so intelligible said Gashford in his unvarying even tone Where is your friend Mr Dennis looked round as in expectation of beholding him asleep upon his bed of straw then remembering he had seen him go out replied I can t say where he is Muster Gashford I expected him back afore now I hope it isn t time that we was busy Muster Gashford Nay said the secretary who should know that as well as you How can I tell you Dennis You are perfect master of your own actions you know and accountable to nobody except sometimes to the law eh Dennis who was very much baffled by the cool matter of course manner of this reply recovered his self possession on his professional pursuits being referred to and pointing towards Barnaby shook his head and frowned Hush cried Barnaby Ah Do hush about that Muster Gashford said the hangman in a low voice pop lar prejudices you always forget well Barnaby my lad what s the matter I hear him coming he answered Hark Do you mark that That s his foot Bless you I know his step and his dog s too Tramp tramp pit pat on they come together and ha ha ha and here they are he cried joyfully welcoming Hugh with both hands and then patting him fondly on the back as if instead of being the rough companion he was he had been one of the most prepossessing of men Here he is and safe too I am glad to see him back again old Hugh I m a Turk if he don t give me a warmer welcome always than any man of sense said Hugh shaking hands with him with a kind of ferocious friendship strange enough to see How are you boy Hearty cried Barnaby waving his hat Ha ha ha And merrry too Hugh And ready to do anything for the good cause and the right and to help the kind mild pale faced gentleman the lord they used so ill eh Hugh Ay returned his friend dropping his hand and looking at Gashford for an instant with a changed expression before he spoke to him Good day master And good day to you replied the secretary nursing his leg And many good days whole years of them I hope You are heated So would you have been master said Hugh wiping his face if you d been running here as fast as I have You know the news then Yes I supposed you would have heard it News what news You don t cried Gashford raising his eyebrows with an exclamation of surprise Dear me Come then I AM the first to make you acquainted with your distinguished position after all Do you see the King s Arms a top he smilingly asked as he took a large paper from his pocket unfolded it and held it out for Hugh s inspection Well said Hugh What s that to me Much A great deal replied the secretary Read it I told you the first time I saw you that I couldn t read said Hugh impatiently What in the Devil s name s inside of it It is a proclamation from the King in Council said Gashford dated to day and offering a reward of five hundred pounds five hundred pounds is a great deal of money and a large temptation to some people to any one who will discover the person or persons most active in demolishing those chapels on Saturday night Is that all cried Hugh with an indifferent air I knew of that Truly I might have known you did said Gashford smiling and folding up the document again Your friend I might have guessed indeed I did guess was sure to tell you My friend stammered Hugh with an unsuccessful effort to appear surprised What friend Tut tut do you suppose I don t know where you have been retorted Gashford rubbing his hands and beating the back of one on the palm of the other and looking at him with a cunning eye How dull you think me Shall I say his name No said Hugh with a hasty glance towards Dennis You have also heard from him no doubt resumed the secretary after a moment s pause that the rioters who have been taken poor fellows are committed for trial and that some very active witnesses have had the temerity to appear against them Among others and here he clenched his teeth as if he would suppress by force some violent words that rose upon his tongue and spoke very slowly Among others a gentleman who saw the work going on in Warwick Street a Catholic gentleman one Haredale Hugh would have prevented his uttering the word but it was out already Hearing the name Barnaby turned swiftly round Duty duty bold Barnaby cried Hugh assuming his wildest and most rapid manner and thrusting into his hand his staff and flag which leant against the wall Mount guard without loss of time for we are off upon our expedition Up Dennis and get ready Take care that no one turns the straw upon my bed brave Barnaby we know what s underneath it eh Now master quick What you have to say say speedily for the little captain and a cluster of em are in the fields and only waiting for us Sharp s the word and strike s the action Quick Barnaby was not proof against this bustle and despatch The look of mingled astonishtnent and anger which had appeared in his face when he turned towards them faded from it as the words passed from his memory like breath from a polished mirror and grasping the weapon which Hugh forced upon him he proudly took his station at the door beyond their hearing You might have spoiled our plans master said Hugh YOU too of all men Who would have supposed that HE would be so quick urged Gashford He s as quick sometimes I don t mean with his hands for that you know but with his head as you or any man said Hugh Dennis it s time we were going they re waiting for us I came to tell you Reach me my stick and belt Here Lend a hand master Fling this over my shoulder and buckle it behind will you Brisk as ever said the secretary adjusting it for him as he desired A man need be brisk to day there s brisk work a foot There is is there said Gashford He said it with such a provoking assumption of ignorance that Hugh looking over his shoulder and angrily down upon him replied Is there You know there is Who knows better than you master that the first great step to be taken is to make examples of these witnesses and frighten all men from appearing against us or any of our body any more There s one we know of returned Gashford with an expressive smile who is at least as well informed upon that subject as you or I If we mean the same gentleman as I suppose we do Hugh rejoined softly I tell you this he s as good and quick information about everything as here he paused and looked round as if to make sure that the person in question was not within hearing as Old Nick himself Have you done that master How slow you are It s quite fast now said Gashford rising I say you didn t find that your friend disapproved of to day s little expedition Ha ha ha It is fortunate it jumps so well with the witness policy for once planned it must have been carried out And now you are going eh Now we are going master Hugh replied Any parting words Oh dear no said Gashford sweetly None You re sure cried Hugh nudging the grinning Dennis Quite sure eh Muster Gashford chuckled the hangman Gashford paused a moment struggling with his caution and his malice then putting himself between the two men and laying a hand upon the arm of each said in a cramped whisper Do not my good friends I am sure you will not forget our talk one night in your house Dennis about this person No mercy no quarter no two beams of his house to be left standing where the builder placed them Fire the saying goes is a good servant but a bad master Makes it HIS master he deserves no better But I am sure you will be firm I am sure you will be very resolute I am sure you will remember that he thirsts for your lives and those of all your brave companions If you ever acted like staunch fellows you will do so to day Won t you Dennis won t you Hugh The two looked at him and at each other then bursting into a roar of laughter brandished their staves above their heads shook hands and hurried out When they had been gone a little time Gashford followed They were yet in sight and hastening to that part of the adjacent fields in which their fellows had already mustered Hugh was looking back and flourishing his hat to Barnaby who delighted with his trust replied in the same way and then resumed his pacing up and down before the stable door where his feet had worn a path already And when Gashford himself was far distant and looked back for the last time he was still walking to and fro with the same measured tread the most devoted and the blithest champion that ever maintained a post and felt his heart lifted up with a brave sense of duty and determination to defend it to the last Smiling at the simplicity of the poor idiot Gashford betook himself to Welbeck Street by a different path from that which he knew the rioters would take and sitting down behind a curtain in one of the upper windows of Lord George Gordon s house waited impatiently for their coming They were so long that although he knew it had been settled they should come that way he had a misgiving they must have changed their plans and taken some other route But at length the roar of voices was heard in the neighbouring fields and soon afterwards they came thronging past in a great body However they were not all nor nearly all in one body but were as he soon found divided into four parties each of which stopped before the house to give three cheers and then went on the leaders crying out in what direction they were going and calling on the spectators to join them The first detachment carrying by way of banners some relics of the havoc they had made in Moorfields proclaimed that they were on their way to Chelsea whence they would return in the same order to make of the spoil they bore a great bonfire near at hand The second gave out that they were bound for Wapping to destroy a chapel the third that their place of destination was East Smithfield and their object the same All this was done in broad bright summer day Gay carriages and chairs stopped to let them pass or turned back to avoid them people on foot stood aside in doorways or perhaps knocked and begged permission to stand at a window or in the hall until the rioters had passed but nobody interfered with them and when they had gone by everything went on as usual There still remained the fourth body and for that the secretary looked with a most intense eagerness At last it came up It was numerous and composed of picked men for as he gazed down among them he recognised many upturned faces which he knew well those of Simon Tappertit Hugh and Dennis in the front of course They halted and cheered as the others had done but when they moved again they did not like them proclaim what design they had Hugh merely raised his hat upon the bludgeon he carried and glancing at a spectator on the opposite side of the way was gone Gashford followed the direction of his glance instinctively and saw standing on the pavement and wearing the blue cockade Sir John Chester He held his hat an inch or two above his head to propitiate the mob and resting gracefully on his cane smiling pleasantly and displaying his dress and person to the very best advantage looked on in the most tranquil state imaginable For all that and quick and dexterous as he was Gashford had seen him recognise Hugh with the air of a patron He had no longer any eyes for the crowd but fixed his keen regards upon Sir John He stood in the same place and posture until the last man in the concourse had turned the corner of the street then very deliberately took the blue cockade out of his hat put it carefully in his pocket ready for the next emergency refreshed himself with a pinch of snuff put up his box and was walking slowly off when a passing carriage stopped and a lady s hand let down the glass Sir John s hat was off again immediately After a minute s conversation at the carriage window in which it was apparent that he was vastly entertaining on the subject of the mob he stepped lightly in and was driven away The secretary smiled but he had other thoughts to dwell upon and soon dismissed the topic Dinner was brought him but he sent it down untasted and in restless pacings up and down the room and constant glances at the clock and many futile efforts to sit down and read or go to sleep or look out of the window consumed four weary hours When the dial told him thus much time had crept away he stole upstairs to the top of the house and coming out upon the roof sat down with his face towards the east Heedless of the fresh air that blew upon his heated brow of the pleasant meadows from which he turned of the piles of roofs and chimneys upon which he looked of the smoke and rising mist he vainly sought to pierce of the shrill cries of children at their evening sports the distant hum and turmoil of the town the cheerful country breath that rustled past to meet it and to droop and die he watched and watched till it was dark save for the specks of light that twinkled in the streets below and far away and as the darkness deepened strained his gaze and grew more eager yet Nothing but gloom in that direction still he muttered restlessly Dog where is the redness in the sky you promised me Chapter 54 Rumours of the prevailing disturbances had by this time begun to be pretty generally circulated through the towns and villages round London and the tidings were everywhere received with that appetite for the marvellous and love of the terrible which have probably been among the natural characteristics of mankind since the creation of the world These accounts however appeared to many persons at that day as they would to us at the present but that we know them to be matter of history so monstrous and improbable that a great number of those who were resident at a distance and who were credulous enough on other points were really unable to bring their minds to believe that such things could be and rejected the intelligence they received on all hands as wholly fabulous and absurd Mr Willet not so much perhaps on account of his having argued and settled the matter with himself as by reason of his constitutional obstinacy was one of those who positively refused to entertain the current topic for a moment On this very evening and perhaps at the very time when Gashford kept his solitary watch old John was so red in the face with perpetually shaking his head in contradiction of his three ancient cronies and pot companions that he was quite a phenomenon to behold and lighted up the Maypole Porch wherein they sat together like a monstrous carbuncle in a fairy tale Do you think sir said Mr Willet looking hard at Solomon Daisy for it was his custom in cases of personal altercation to fasten upon the smallest man in the party do you think sir that I m a born fool No no Johnny returned Solomon looking round upon the little circle of which he formed a part We all know better than that You re no fool Johnny No no Mr Cobb and Mr Parkes shook their heads in unison muttering No no Johnny not you But as such compliments had usually the effect of making Mr Willet rather more dogged than before he surveyed them with a look of deep disdain and returned for answer Then what do you mean by coming here and telling me that this evening you re a going to walk up to London together you three you and have the evidence of your own senses An t said Mr Willet putting his pipe in his mouth with an air of solemn disgust an t the evidence of MY senses enough for you But we haven t got it Johnny pleaded Parkes humbly You haven t got it sir repeated Mr Willet eyeing him from top to toe You haven t got it sir You HAVE got it sir Don t I tell you that His blessed Majesty King George the Third would no more stand a rioting and rollicking in his streets than he d stand being crowed over by his own Parliament Yes Johnny but that s your sense not your senses said the adventurous Mr Parkes How do you know retorted John with great dignity You re a contradicting pretty free you are sir How do YOU know which it is I m not aware I ever told you sir Mr Parkes finding himself in the position of having got into metaphysics without exactly seeing his way out of them stammered forth an apology and retreated from the argument There then ensued a silence of some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at the expiration of which period Mr Willet was observed to rumble and shake with laughter and presently remarked in reference to his late adversary that he hoped he had tackled him enough Thereupon Messrs Cobb and Daisy laughed and nodded and Parkes was looked upon as thoroughly and effectually put down Do you suppose if all this was true that Mr Haredale would be constantly away from home as he is said John after another silence Do you think he wouldn t be afraid to leave his house with them two young women in it and only a couple of men or so Ay but then you know returned Solomon Daisy his house is a goodish way out of London and they do say that the rioters won t go more than two miles or three at the farthest off the stones Besides you know some of the Catholic gentlefolks have actually sent trinkets and suchlike down here for safety at least so the story goes The story goes said Mr Willet testily Yes sir The story goes that you saw a ghost last March But nobody believes it Well said Solomon rising to divert the attention of his two friends who tittered at this retort believed or disbelieved it s true and true or not if we mean to go to London we must be going at once So shake hands Johnny and good night I shall shake hands returned the landlord putting his into his pockets with no man as goes to London on such nonsensical errands The three cronies were therefore reduced to the necessity of shaking his elbows having performed that ceremony and brought from the house their hats and sticks and greatcoats they bade him good night and departed promising to bring him on the morrow full and true accounts of the real state of the city and if it were quiet to give him the full merit of his victory John Willet looked after them as they plodded along the road in the rich glow of a summer evening and knocking the ashes out of his pipe laughed inwardly at their folly until his sides were sore When he had quite exhausted himself which took some time for he laughed as slowly as he thought and spoke he sat himself comfortably with his back to the house put his legs upon the bench then his apron over his face and fell sound asleep How long he slept matters not but it was for no brief space for when he awoke the rich light had faded the sombre hues of night were falling fast upon the landscape and a few bright stars were already twinkling overhead The birds were all at roost the daisies on the green had closed their fairy hoods the honeysuckle twining round the porch exhaled its perfume in a twofold degree as though it lost its coyness at that silent time and loved to shed its fragrance on the night the ivy scarcely stirred its deep green leaves How tranquil and how beautiful it was Was there no sound in the air besides the gentle rustling of the trees and the grasshopper s merry chirp Hark Something very faint and distant not unlike the murmuring in a sea shell Now it grew louder fainter now and now it altogether died away Presently it came again subsided came once more grew louder fainter swelled into a roar It was on the road and varied with its windings All at once it burst into a distinct sound the voices and the tramping feet of many men It is questionable whether old John Willet even then would have thought of the rioters but for the cries of his cook and housemaid who ran screaming upstairs and locked themselves into one of the old garrets shrieking dismally when they had done so by way of rendering their place of refuge perfectly secret and secure These two females did afterwards depone that Mr Willet in his consternation uttered but one word and called that up the stairs in a stentorian voice six distinct times But as this word was a monosyllable which however inoffensive when applied to the quadruped it denotes is highly reprehensible when used in connection with females of unimpeachable character many persons were inclined to believe that the young women laboured under some hallucination caused by excessive fear and that their ears deceived them Be this as it may John Willet in whom the very uttermost extent of dull headed perplexity supplied the place of courage stationed himself in the porch and waited for their coming up Once it dimly occurred to him that there was a kind of door to the house which had a lock and bolts and at the same time some shadowy ideas of shutters to the lower windows flitted through his brain But he stood stock still looking down the road in the direction in which the noise was rapidly advancing and did not so much as take his hands out of his pockets He had not to wait long A dark mass looming through a cloud of dust soon became visible the mob quickened their pace shouting and whooping like savages they came rushing on pell mell and in a few seconds he was bandied from hand to hand in the heart of a crowd of men Halloa cried a voice he knew as the man who spoke came cleaving through the throng Where is he Give him to me Don t hurt him How now old Jack Ha ha ha Mr Willet looked at him and saw it was Hugh but he said nothing and thought nothing These lads are thirsty and must drink cried Hugh thrusting him back towards the house Bustle Jack bustle Show us the best the very best the over proof that you keep for your own drinking Jack John faintly articulated the words Who s to pay He says Who s to pay cried Hugh with a roar of laughter which was loudly echoed by the crowd Then turning to John he added Pay Why nobody John stared round at the mass of faces some grinning some fierce some lighted up by torches some indistinct some dusky and shadowy some looking at him some at his house some at each other and while he was as he thought in the very act of doing so found himself without any consciousness of having moved in the bar sitting down in an arm chair and watching the destruction of his property as if it were some queer play or entertainment of an astonishing and stupefying nature but having no reference to himself that he could make out at all Yes Here was the bar the bar that the boldest never entered without special invitation the sanctuary the mystery the hallowed ground here it was crammed with men clubs sticks torches pistols filled with a deafening noise oaths shouts screams hootings changed all at once into a bear garden a madhouse an infernal temple men darting in and out by door and window smashing the glass turning the taps drinking liquor out of China punchbowls sitting astride of casks smoking private and personal pipes cutting down the sacred grove of lemons hacking and hewing at the celebrated cheese breaking open inviolable drawers putting things in their pockets which didn t belong to them dividing his own money before his own eyes wantonly wasting breaking pulling down and tearing up nothing quiet nothing private men everywhere above below overhead in the bedrooms in the kitchen in the yard in the stables clambering in at windows when there were doors wide open dropping out of windows when the stairs were handy leaping over the bannisters into chasms of passages new faces and figures presenting themselves every instant some yelling some singing some fighting some breaking glass and crockery some laying the dust with the liquor they couldn t drink some ringing the bells till they pulled them down others beating them with pokers till they beat them into fragments more men still more more more swarming on like insects noise smoke light darkness frolic anger laughter groans plunder fear and ruin Nearly all the time while John looked on at this bewildering scene Hugh kept near him and though he was the loudest wildest most destructive villain there he saved his old master s bones a score of times Nay even when Mr Tappertit excited by liquor came up and in assertion of his prerogative politely kicked John Willet on the shins Hugh bade him return the compliment and if old John had had sufficient presence of mind to understand this whispered direction and to profit by it he might no doubt under Hugh s protection have done so with impunity At length the band began to reassemble outside the house and to call to those within to join them for they were losing time These murmurs increasing and attaining a high pitch Hugh and some of those who yet lingered in the bar and who plainly were the leaders of the troop took counsel together apart as to what was to be done with John to keep him quiet until their Chigwell work was over Some proposed to set the house on fire and leave him in it others that he should be reduced to a state of temporary insensibility by knocking on the head others that he should be sworn to sit where he was until to morrow at the same hour others again that he should be gagged and taken off with them under a sufficient guard All these propositions being overruled it was concluded at last to bind him in his chair and the word was passed for Dennis Look ee here Jack said Hugh striding up to him We are going to tie you hand and foot but otherwise you won t be hurt D ye hear John Willet looked at another man as if he didn t know which was the speaker and muttered something about an ordinary every Sunday at two o clock You won t be hurt I tell you Jack do you hear me roared Hugh impressing the assurance upon him by means of a heavy blow on the back He s so dead scared he s woolgathering I think Give him a drop of something to drink here Hand over one of you A glass of liquor being passed forward Hugh poured the contents down old John s throat Mr Willet feebly smacked his lips thrust his hand into his pocket and inquired what was to pay adding as he looked vacantly round that he believed there was a trifle of broken glass He s out of his senses for the time it s my belief said Hugh after shaking him without any visible effect upon his system until his keys rattled in his pocket Where s that Dennis The word was again passed and presently Mr Dennis with a long cord bound about his middle something after the manner of a friar came hurrying in attended by a body guard of half a dozen of his men Come Be alive here cried Hugh stamping his foot upon the ground Make haste Dennis with a wink and a nod unwound the cord from about his person and raising his eyes to the ceiling looked all over it and round the walls and cornice with a curious eye then shook his head Move man can t you cried Hugh with another impatient stamp of his foot Are we to wait here till the cry has gone for ten miles round and our work s interrupted It s all very fine talking brother answered Dennis stepping towards him but unless and here he whispered in his ear unless we do it over the door it can t be done at all in this here room What can t Hugh demanded What can t retorted Dennis Why the old man can t Why you weren t going to hang him cried Hugh No brother returned the hangman with a stare What else Hugh made no answer but snatching the rope from his companion s hand proceeded to bind old John himself but his very first move was so bungling and unskilful that Mr Dennis entreated almost with tears in his eyes that he might be permitted to perform the duty Hugh consenting be achieved it in a twinkling There he said looking mournfully at John Willet who displayed no more emotion in his bonds than he had shown out of them That s what I call pretty and workmanlike He s quite a picter now But brother just a word with you now that he s ready trussed as one may say wouldn t it be better for all parties if we was to work him off It would read uncommon well in the newspapers it would indeed The public would think a great deal more on us Hugh inferring what his companion meant rather from his gestures than his technical mode of expressing himself to which as he was ignorant of his calling he wanted the clue rejected this proposition for the second time and gave the word Forward which was echoed by a hundred voices from without To the Warren shouted Dennis as he ran out followed by the rest A witness s house my lads A loud yell followed and the whole throng hurried off mad for pillage and destruction Hugh lingered behind for a few moments to stimulate himself with more drink and to set all the taps running a few of which had accidentally been spared then glancing round the despoiled and plundered room through whose shattered window the rioters had thrust the Maypole itself for even that had been sawn down lighted a torch clapped the mute and motionless John Willet on the back and waving his light above his head and uttering a fierce shout hastened after his companions Chapter 55 John Willet left alone in his dismantled bar continued to sit staring about him awake as to his eyes certainly but with all his powers of reason and reflection in a sound and dreamless sleep He looked round upon the room which had been for years and was within an hour ago the pride of his heart and not a muscle of his face was moved The night without looked black and cold through the dreary gaps in the casement the precious liquids now nearly leaked away dripped with a hollow sound upon the floor the Maypole peered ruefully in through the broken window like the bowsprit of a wrecked ship the ground might have been the bottom of the sea it was so strewn with precious fragments Currents of air rushed in as the old doors jarred and creaked upon their hinges the candles flickered and guttered down and made long winding sheets the cheery deep red curtains flapped and fluttered idly in the wind even the stout Dutch kegs overthrown and lying empty in dark corners seemed the mere husks of good fellows whose jollity had departed and who could kindle with a friendly glow no more John saw this desolation and yet saw it not He was perfectly contented to sit there staring at it and felt no more indignation or discomfort in his bonds than if they had been robes of honour So far as he was personally concerned old Time lay snoring and the world stood still Save for the dripping from the barrels the rustling of such light fragments of destruction as the wind affected and the dull creaking of the open doors all was profoundly quiet indeed these sounds like the ticking of the death watch in the night only made the silence they invaded deeper and more apparent But quiet or noisy it was all one to John If a train of heavy artillery could have come up and commenced ball practice outside the window it would have been all the same to him He was a long way beyond surprise A ghost couldn t have overtaken him By and by he heard a footstep a hurried and yet cautious footstep coming on towards the house It stopped advanced again then seemed to go quite round it Having done that it came beneath the window and a head looked in It was strongly relieved against the darkness outside by the glare of the guttering candles A pale worn withered face the eyes but that was owing to its gaunt condition unnaturally large and bright the hair a grizzled black It gave a searching glance all round the room and a deep voice said Are you alone in this house John made no sign though the question was repeated twice and he heard it distinctly After a moment s pause the man got in at the window John was not at all surprised at this either There had been so much getting in and out of window in the course of the last hour or so that he had quite forgotten the door and seemed to have lived among such exercises from infancy The man wore a large dark faded cloak and a slouched hat he walked up close to John and looked at him John returned the compliment with interest How long have you been sitting thus said the man John considered but nothing came of it Which way have the party gone Some wandering speculations relative to the fashion of the stranger s boots got into Mr Willet s mind by some accident or other but they got out again in a hurry and left him in his former state You would do well to speak said the man you may keep a whole skin though you have nothing else left that can be hurt Which way have the party gone That said John finding his voice all at once and nodding with perfect good faith he couldn t point he was so tightly bound in exactly the opposite direction to the right one You lie said the man angrily and with a threatening gesture I came that way You would betray me It was so evident that John s imperturbability was not assumed but was the result of the late proceedings under his roof that the man stayed his hand in the very act of striking him and turned away John looked after him without so much as a twitch in a single nerve of his face He seized a glass and holding it under one of the little casks until a few drops were collected drank them greedily off then throwing it down upon the floor impatiently he took the vessel in his hands and drained it into his throat Some scraps of bread and meat were scattered about and on these he fell next eating them with voracity and pausing every now and then to listen for some fancied noise outside When he had refreshed himself in this manner with violent haste and raised another barrel to his lips he pulled his hat upon his brow as though he were about to leave the house and turned to John Where are your servants Mr Willet indistinctly remembered to have heard the rioters calling to them to throw the key of the room in which they were out of window for their keeping He therefore replied Locked up Well for them if they remain quiet and well for you if you do the like said the man Now show me the way the party went This time Mr Willet indicated it correctly The man was hurrying to the door when suddenly there came towards them on the wind the loud and rapid tolling of an alarm bell and then a bright and vivid glare streamed up which illumined not only the whole chamber but all the country It was not the sudden change from darkness to this dreadful light it was not the sound of distant shrieks and shouts of triumph it was not this dread invasion of the serenity and peace of night that drove the man back as though a thunderbolt had struck him It was the Bell If the ghastliest shape the human mind has ever pictured in its wildest dreams had risen up before him he could not have staggered backward from its touch as he did from the first sound of that loud iron voice With eyes that started from his head his limbs convulsed his face most horrible to see he raised one arm high up into the air and holding something visionary back and down with his other hand drove at it as though he held a knife and stabbed it to the heart He clutched his hair and stopped his ears and travelled madly round and round then gave a frightful cry and with it rushed away still still the Bell tolled on and seemed to follow him louder and louder hotter and hotter yet The glare grew brighter the roar of voices deeper the crash of heavy bodies falling shook the air bright streams of sparks rose up into the sky but louder than them all rising faster far to Heaven a million times more fierce and furious pouring forth dreadful secrets after its long silence speaking the language of the dead the Bell the Bell What hunt of spectres could surpass that dread pursuit and flight Had there been a legion of them on his track he could have better borne it They would have had a beginning and an end but here all space was full The one pursuing voice was everywhere it sounded in the earth the air shook the long grass and howled among the trembling trees The echoes caught it up the owls hooted as it flew upon the breeze the nightingale was silent and hid herself among the thickest boughs it seemed to goad and urge the angry fire and lash it into madness everything was steeped in one prevailing red the glow was everywhere nature was drenched in blood still the remorseless crying of that awful voice the Bell the Bell It ceased but not in his ears The knell was at his heart No work of man had ever voice like that which sounded there and warned him that it cried unceasingly to Heaven Who could hear that hell and not know what it said There was murder in its every note cruel relentless savage murder the murder of a confiding man by one who held his every trust Its ringing summoned phantoms from their graves What face was that in which a friendly smile changed to a look of half incredulous horror which stiffened for a moment into one of pain then changed again into an imploring glance at Heaven and so fell idly down with upturned eyes like the dead stags he had often peeped at when a little child shrinking and shuddering there was a dreadful thing to think of now and clinging to an apron as he looked He sank upon the ground and grovelling down as if he would dig himself a place to hide in covered his face and ears but no no no a hundred walls and roofs of brass would not shut out that bell for in it spoke the wrathful voice of God and from that voice the whole wide universe could not afford a refuge While he rushed up and down not knowing where to turn and while he lay crouching there the work went briskly on indeed When they left the Maypole the rioters formed into a solid body and advanced at a quick pace towards the Warren Rumour of their approach having gone before they found the garden doors fast closed the windows made secure and the house profoundly dark not a light being visible in any portion of the building After some fruitless ringing at the bells and beating at the iron gates they drew off a few paces to reconnoitre and confer upon the course it would be best to take Very little conference was needed when all were bent upon one desperate purpose infuriated with liquor and flushed with successful riot The word being given to surround the house some climbed the gates or dropped into the shallow trench and scaled the garden wall while others pulled down the solid iron fence and while they made a breach to enter by made deadly weapons of the bars The house being completely encircled a small number of men were despatched to break open a tool shed in the garden and during their absence on this errand the remainder contented themselves with knocking violently at the doors and calling to those within to come down and open them on peril of their lives No answer being returned to this repeated summons and the detachment who had been sent away coming back with an accession of pickaxes spades and hoes they together with those who had such arms already or carried as many did axes poles and crowbars struggled into the foremost rank ready to beset the doors and windows They had not at this time more than a dozen lighted torches among them but when these preparations were completed flaming links were distributed and passed from hand to hand with such rapidity that in a minute s time at least two thirds of the whole roaring mass bore each man in his hand a blazing brand Whirling these about their heads they raised a loud shout and fell to work upon the doors and windows Amidst the clattering of heavy blows the rattling of broken glass the cries and execrations of the mob and all the din and turmoil of the scene Hugh and his friends kept together at the turret door where Mr Haredale had last admitted him and old John Willet and spent their united force on that It was a strong old oaken door guarded by good bolts and a heavy bar but it soon went crashing in upon the narrow stairs behind and made as it were a platform to facilitate their tearing up into the rooms above Almost at the same moment a dozen other points were forced and at every one the crowd poured in like water A few armed servant men were posted in the hall and when the rioters forced an entrance there they fired some half a dozen shots But these taking no effect and the concourse coming on like an army of devils they only thought of consulting their own safety and retreated echoing their assailants cries and hoping in the confusion to be taken for rioters themselves in which stratagem they succeeded with the exception of one old man who was never heard of again and was said to have had his brains beaten out with an iron bar one of his fellows reported that he had seen the old man fall and to have been afterwards burnt in the flames The besiegers being now in complete possession of the house spread themselves over it from garret to cellar and plied their demon labours fiercely While some small parties kindled bonfires underneath the windows others broke up the furniture and cast the fragments down to feed the flames below where the apertures in the wall windows no longer were large enough they threw out tables chests of drawers beds mirrors pictures and flung them whole into the fire while every fresh addition to the blazing masses was received with shouts and howls and yells which added new and dismal terrors to the conflagration Those who had axes and had spent their fury on the movables chopped and tore down the doors and window frames broke up the flooring hewed away the rafters and buried men who lingered in the upper rooms in heaps of ruins Some searched the drawers the chests the boxes writing desks and closets for jewels plate and money while others less mindful of gain and more mad for destruction cast their whole contents into the courtyard without examination and called to those below to heap them on the blaze Men who had been into the cellars and had staved the casks rushed to and fro stark mad setting fire to all they saw often to the dresses of their own friends and kindling the building in so many parts that some had no time for escape and were seen with drooping hands and blackened faces hanging senseless on the window sills to which they had crawled until they were sucked and drawn into the burning gulf The more the fire crackled and raged the wilder and more cruel the men grew as though moving in that element they became fiends and changed their earthly nature for the qualities that give delight in hell The burning pile revealing rooms and passages red hot through gaps made in the crumbling walls the tributary fires that licked the outer bricks and stones with their long forked tongues and ran up to meet the glowing mass within the shining of the flames upon the villains who looked on and fed them the roaring of the angry blaze so bright and high that it seemed in its rapacity to have swallowed up the very smoke the living flakes the wind bore rapidly away and hurried on with like a storm of fiery snow the noiseless breaking of great beams of wood which fell like feathers on the heap of ashes and crumbled in the very act to sparks and powder the lurid tinge that overspread the sky and the darkness very deep by contrast which prevailed around the exposure to the coarse common gaze of every little nook which usages of home had made a sacred place and the destruction by rude hands of every little household favourite which old associations made a dear and precious thing all this taking place not among pitying looks and friendly murmurs of compassion but brutal shouts and exultations which seemed to make the very rats who stood by the old house too long creatures with some claim upon the pity and regard of those its roof had sheltered combined to form a scene never to be forgotten by those who saw it and were not actors in the work so long as life endured And who were they The alarm bell rang and it was pulled by no faint or hesitating hands for a long time but not a soul was seen Some of the insurgents said that when it ceased they heard the shrieks of women and saw some garments fluttering in the air as a party of men bore away no unresisting burdens No one could say that this was true or false in such an uproar but where was Hugh Who among them had seen him since the forcing of the doors The cry spread through the body Where was Hugh Here he hoarsely cried appearing from the darkness out of breath and blackened with the smoke We have done all we can the fire is burning itself out and even the corners where it hasn t spread are nothing but heaps of ruins Disperse my lads while the coast s clear get back by different ways and meet as usual With that he disappeared again contrary to his wont for he was always first to advance and last to go away leaving them to follow homewards as they would It was not an easy task to draw off such a throng If Bedlam gates had been flung wide open there would not have issued forth such maniacs as the frenzy of that night had made There were men there who danced and trampled on the beds of flowers as though they trod down human enemies and wrenched them from the stalks like savages who twisted human necks There were men who cast their lighted torches in the air and suffered them to fall upon their heads and faces blistering the skin with deep unseemly burns There were men who rushed up to the fire and paddled in it with their hands as if in water and others who were restrained by force from plunging in to gratify their deadly longing On the skull of one drunken lad not twenty by his looks who lay upon the ground with a bottle to his mouth the lead from the roof came streaming down in a shower of liquid fire white hot melting his head like wax When the scattered parties were collected men living yet but singed as with hot irons were plucked out of the cellars and carried off upon the shoulders of others who strove to wake them as they went along with ribald jokes and left them dead in the passages of hospitals But of all the howling throng not one learnt mercy from or sickened at these sights nor was the fierce besotted senseless rage of one man glutted Slowly and in small clusters with hoarse hurrahs and repetitions of their usual cry the assembly dropped away The last few red eyed stragglers reeled after those who had gone before the distant noise of men calling to each other and whistling for others whom they missed grew fainter and fainter at length even these sounds died away and silence reigned alone Silence indeed The glare of the flames had sunk into a fitful flashing light and the gentle stars invisible till now looked down upon the blackening heap A dull smoke hung upon the ruin as though to hide it from those eyes of Heaven and the wind forbore to move it Bare walls roof open to the sky chambers where the beloved dead had many and many a fair day risen to new life and energy where so many dear ones had been sad and merry which were connected with so many thoughts and hopes regrets and changes all gone Nothing left but a dull and dreary blank a smouldering heap of dust and ashes the silence and solitude of utter desolation Chapter 56 The Maypole cronies little drearning of the change so soon to come upon their favourite haunt struck through the Forest path upon their way to London and avoiding the main road which was hot and dusty kept to the by paths and the fields As they drew nearer to their destination they began to make inquiries of the people whom they passed concerning the riots and the truth or falsehood of the stories they had heard The answers went far beyond any intelligence that had spread to quiet Chigwell One man told them that that afternoon the Guards conveying to Newgate some rioters who had been re examined had been set upon by the mob and compelled to retreat another that the houses of two witnesses near Clare Market were about to be pulled down when he came away another that Sir George Saville s house in Leicester Fields was to be burned that night and that it would go hard with Sir George if he fell into the people s hands as it was he who had brought in the Catholic bill All accounts agreed that the mob were out in stronger numbers and more numerous parties than had yet appeared that the streets were unsafe that no man s house or life was worth an hour s purchase that the public consternation was increasing every moment and that many families had already fled the city One fellow who wore the popular colour damned them for not having cockades in their hats and bade them set a good watch to morrow night upon their prison doors for the locks would have a straining another asked if they were fire proof that they walked abroad without the distinguishing mark of all good and true men and a third who rode on horseback and was quite alone ordered them to throw each man a shilling in his hat towards the support of the rioters Although they were afraid to refuse compliance with this demand and were much alarmed by these reports they agreed having come so far to go forward and see the real state of things with their own eyes So they pushed on quicker as men do who are excited by portentous news and ruminating on what they had heard spoke little to each other It was now night and as they came nearer to the city they had dismal confirmation of this intelligence in three great fires all close together which burnt fiercely and were gloomily reflected in the sky Arriving in the immediate suburbs they found that almost every house had chalked upon its door in large characters No Popery that the shops were shut and that alarm and anxiety were depicted in every face they passed Noting these things with a degree of apprehension which neither of the three cared to impart in its full extent to his companions they came to a turnpike gate which was shut They were passing through the turnstile on the path when a horseman rode up from London at a hard gallop and called to the toll keeper in a voice of great agitation to open quickly in the name of God The adjuration was so earnest and vehement that the man with a lantern in his hand came running out toll keeper though he was and was about to throw the gate open when happening to look behind him he exclaimed Good Heaven what s that Another fire At this the three turned their heads and saw in the distance straight in the direction whence they had come a broad sheet of flame casting a threatening light upon the clouds which glimmered as though the conflagration were behind them and showed like a wrathful sunset My mind misgives me said the horseman or I know from what far building those flames come Don t stand aghast my good fellow Open the gate Sir cried the man laying his hand upon his horse s bridle as he let him through I know you now sir be advised by me do not go on I saw them pass and know what kind of men they are You will be murdered So be it said the horseman looking intently towards the fire and not at him who spoke But sir sir cried the man grasping at his rein more tightly yet if you do go on wear the blue riband Here sir he added taking one from his own hat it s necessity not choice that makes me wear it it s love of life and home sir Wear it for this one night sir only for this one night Do cried the three friends pressing round his horse Mr Haredale worthy sir good gentleman pray be persuaded Who s that cried Mr Haredale stooping down to look Did I hear Daisy s voice You did sir cried the little man Do be persuaded sir This gentleman says very true Your life may hang upon it Are you said Mr Haredale abruptly afraid to come with me I sir N n no Put that riband in your hat If we meet the rioters swear that I took you prisoner for wearing it I will tell them so with my own lips for as I hope for mercy when I die I will take no quarter from them nor shall they have quarter from me if we come hand to hand to night Up here behind me quick Clasp me tight round the body and fear nothing In an instant they were riding away at full gallop in a dense cloud of dust and speeding on like hunters in a dream It was well the good horse knew the road he traversed for never once no never once in all the journey did Mr Haredale cast his eyes upon the ground or turn them for an instant from the light towards which they sped so madly Once he said in a low voice It is my house but that was the only time he spoke When they came to dark and doubtful places he never forgot to put his hand upon the little man to hold him more securely in his seat but he kept his head erect and his eyes fixed on the fire then and always The road was dangerous enough for they went the nearest way headlong far from the highway by lonely lanes and paths where waggon wheels had worn deep ruts where hedge and ditch hemmed in the narrow strip of ground and tall trees arching overhead made it profoundly dark But on on on with neither stop nor stumble till they reached the Maypole door and could plainly see that the fire began to fade as if for want of fuel Down for one moment for but one moment said Mr Haredale helping Daisy to the ground and following himself Willet Willet where are my niece and servants Willet Crying to him distractedly he rushed into the bar The landlord bound and fastened to his chair the place dismantled stripped and pulled about his ears nobody could have taken shelter here He was a strong man accustomed to restrain himself and suppress his strong emotions but this preparation for what was to follow though he had seen that fire burning and knew that his house must be razed to the ground was more than he could bear He covered his face with his hands for a moment and turned away his head Johnny Johnny said Solomon and the simple hearted fellow cried outright and wrung his hands Oh dear old Johnny here s a change That the Maypole bar should come to this and we should live to see it The old Warren too Johnny Mr Haredale oh Johnny what a piteous sight this is Pointing to Mr Haredale as he said these words little Solomon Daisy put his elbows on the back of Mr Willet s chair and fairly blubbered on his shoulder While Solomon was speaking old John sat mute as a stock fish staring at him with an unearthly glare and displaying by every possible symptom entire and complete unconsciousness But when Solomon was silent again John followed with his great round eyes the direction of his looks and did appear to have some dawning distant notion that somebody had come to see him You know us don t you Johnny said the little clerk rapping himself on the breast Daisy you know Chigwell Church bell ringer little desk on Sundays eh Johnny Mr Willet reflected for a few moments and then muttered as it were mechanically Let us sing to the praise and glory of Yes to be sure cried the little man hastily that s it that s me Johnny You re all right now an t you Say you re all right Johnny All right pondered Mr Willet as if that were a matter entirely between himself and his conscience All right Ah They haven t been misusing you with sticks or pokers or any other blunt instruments have they Johnny asked Solomon with a very anxious glance at Mr Willet s head They didn t beat you did they John knitted his brow looked downwards as if he were mentally engaged in some arithmetical calculation then upwards as if the total would not come at his call then at Solomon Daisy from his eyebrow to his shoe buckle then very slowly round the bar And then a great round leaden looking and not at all transparent tear came rolling out of each eye and he said as he shook his head If they d only had the goodness to murder me I d have thanked em kindly No no no don t say that Johnny whimpered his little friend It s very very bad but not quite so bad as that No no Look ee here sir cried John turning his rueful eyes on Mr Haredale who had dropped on one knee and was hastily beginning to untie his bonds Look ee here sir The very Maypole the old dumb Maypole stares in at the winder as if it said John Willet John Willet let s go and pitch ourselves in the nighest pool of water as is deep enough to hold us for our day is over Don t Johnny don t cried his friend no less affected with this mournful effort of Mr Willet s imagination than by the sepulchral tone in which he had spoken of the Maypole Please don t Johnny Your loss is great and your misfortune a heavy one said Mr Haredale looking restlessly towards the door and this is not a time to comfort you If it were I am in no condition to do so Before I leave you tell me one thing and try to tell me plainly I implore you Have you seen or heard of Emma No said Mr Willet Nor any one but these bloodhounds No They rode away I trust in Heaven before these dreadful scenes began said Mr Haredale who between his agitation his eagerness to mount his horse again and the dexterity with which the cords were tied had scarcely yet undone one knot A knife Daisy You didn t said John looking about as though he had lost his pocket handkerchief or some such slight article either of you gentlemen see a a coffin anywheres did you Willet cried Mr Haredale Solomon dropped the knife and instantly becoming limp from head to foot exclaimed Good gracious Because said John not at all regarding them a dead man called a little time ago on his way yonder I could have told you what name was on the plate if he had brought his coffin with him and left it behind If he didn t it don t signify His landlord who had listened to these words with breathless attention started that moment to his feet and without a word drew Solomon Daisy to the door mounted his horse took him up behind again and flew rather than galloped towards the pile of ruins which that day s sun had shone upon a stately house Mr Willet stared after them listened looked down upon himself to make quite sure that he was still unbound and without any manifestation of impatience disappointment or surprise gently relapsed into the condition from which he had so imperfectly recovered Mr Haredale tied his horse to the trunk of a tree and grasping his companion s arm stole softly along the footpath and into what had been the garden of his house He stopped for an instant to look upon its smoking walls and at the stars that shone through roof and floor upon the heap of crumbling ashes Solomon glanced timidly in his face but his lips were tightly pressed together a resolute and stern expression sat upon his brow and not a tear a look or gesture indicating grief escaped him He drew his sword felt for a moment in his breast as though he carried other arms about him then grasping Solomon by the wrist again went with a cautious step all round the house He looked into every doorway and gap in the wall retraced his steps at every rustling of the air among the leaves and searched in every shadowed nook with outstretched hands Thus they made the circuit of the building but they returned to the spot from which they had set out without encountering any human being or finding the least trace of any concealed straggler After a short pause Mr Haredale shouted twice or thrice Then cried aloud Is there any one in hiding here who knows my voice There is nothing to fear now If any of my people are near I entreat them to answer He called them all by name his voice was echoed in many mournful tones then all was silent as before They were standing near the foot of the turret where the alarm bell hung The fire had raged there and the floors had been sawn and hewn and beaten down besides It was open to the night but a part of the staircase still remained winding upward from a great mound of dust and cinders Fragments of the jagged and broken steps offered an insecure and giddy footing here and there and then were lost again behind protruding angles of the wall or in the deep shadows cast upon it by other portions of the ruin for by this time the moon had risen and shone brightly As they stood here listening to the echoes as they died away and hoping in vain to hear a voice they knew some of the ashes in this turret slipped and rolled down Startled by the least noise in that melancholy place Solomon looked up in his companion s face and saw that he had turned towards the spot and that he watched and listened keenly He covered the little man s mouth with his hand and looked again Instantly with kindling eyes he bade him on his life keep still and neither speak nor move Then holding his breath and stooping down he stole into the turret with his drawn sword in his hand and disappeared Terrified to be left there by himself under such desolate circumstances and after all he had seen and heard that night Solomon would have followed but there had been something in Mr Haredale s manner and his look the recollection of which held him spellbound He stood rooted to the spot and scarcely venturing to breathe looked up with mingled fear and wonder Again the ashes slipped and rolled very very softly again and then again as though they crumbled underneath the tread of a stealthy foot And now a figure was dimly visible climbing very softly and often stopping to look down now it pursued its difficult way and now it was hidden from the view again It emerged once more into the shadowy and uncertain light higher now but not much for the way was steep and toilsome and its progress very slow What phantom of the brain did he pursue and why did he look down so constantly He knew he was alone Surely his mind was not affected by that night s loss and agony He was not about to throw himself headlong from the summit of the tottering wall Solomon turned sick and clasped his hands His limbs trembled beneath him and a cold sweat broke out upon his pallid face If he complied with Mr Haredale s last injunction now it was because he had not the power to speak or move He strained his gaze and fixed it on a patch of moonlight into which if he continued to ascend he must soon emerge When he appeared there he would try to call to him Again the ashes slipped and crumbled some stones rolled down and fell with a dull heavy sound upon the ground below He kept his eyes upon the piece of moonlight The figure was coming on for its shadow was already thrown upon the wall Now it appeared and now looked round at him and now The horror stricken clerk uttered a scream that pierced the air and cried The ghost The ghost Long before the echo of his cry had died away another form rushed out into the light flung itself upon the foremost one knelt down upon its breast and clutched its throat with both hands Villain cried Mr Haredale in a terrible voice for it was he Dead and buried as all men supposed through your infernal arts but reserved by Heaven for this at last at last I have you You whose hands are red with my brother s blood and that of his faithful servant shed to conceal your own atrocious guilt You Rudge double murderer and monster I arrest you in the name of God who has delivered you into my hands No Though you had the strength of twenty men he added as the murderer writhed and struggled you could not escape me or loosen my grasp to night Chapter 57 Barnaby armed as we have seen continued to pace up and down before the stable door glad to be alone again and heartily rejoicing in the unaccustomed silence and tranquillity After the whirl of noise and riot in which the last two days had been passed the pleasures of solitude and peace were enhanced a thousandfold He felt quite happy and as he leaned upon his staff and mused a bright smile overspread his face and none but cheerful visions floated into his brain Had he no thoughts of her whose sole delight he was and whom he had unconsciously plunged in such bitter sorrow and such deep affliction Oh yes She was at the heart of all his cheerful hopes and proud reflections It was she whom all this honour and distinction were to gladden the joy and profit were for her What delight it gave her to hear of the bravery of her poor boy Ah He would have known that without Hugh s telling him And what a precious thing it was to know she lived so happily and heard with so much pride he pictured to himself her look when they told her that he was in such high esteem bold among the boldest and trusted before them all And when these frays were over and the good lord had conquered his enemies and they were all at peace again and he and she were rich what happiness they would have in talking of these troubled times when he was a great soldier and when they sat alone together in the tranquil twilight and she had no longer reason to be anxious for the morrow what pleasure would he have in the reflection that this was his doing his poor foolish Barnaby s and in patting her on the cheek and saying with a merry laugh Am I silly now mother am I silly now With a lighter heart and step and eyes the brighter for the happy tear that dimmed them for a moment Barnaby resumed his walk and singing gaily to himself kept guard upon his quiet post His comrade Grip the partner of his watch though fond of basking in the sunshine preferred to day to walk about the stable having a great deal to do in the way of scattering the straw hiding under it such small articles as had been casually left about and haunting Hugh s bed to which he seemed to have taken a particular attachment Sometimes Barnaby looked in and called him and then he came hopping out but he merely did this as a concession to his master s weakness and soon returned again to his own grave pursuits peering into the straw with his bill and rapidly covering up the place as if Midas like he were whispering secrets to the earth and burying them constantly busying himself upon the sly and affecting whenever Barnaby came past to look up in the clouds and have nothing whatever on his mind in short conducting himself in many respects in a more than usually thoughtful deep and mysterious manner As the day crept on Barnaby who had no directions forbidding him to eat and drink upon his post but had been on the contrary supplied with a bottle of beer and a basket of provisions determined to break his fast which he had not done since morning To this end he sat down on the ground before the door and putting his staff across his knees in case of alarm or surprise summoned Grip to dinner This call the bird obeyed with great alacrity crying as he sidled up to his master I m a devil I m a Polly I m a kettle I m a Protestant No Popery Having learnt this latter sentiment from the gentry among whom he had lived of late he delivered it with uncommon emphasis Well said Grip cried his master as he fed him with the daintiest bits Well said old boy Never say die bow wow wow keep up your spirits Grip Grip Grip Holloa We ll all have tea I m a Protestant kettle No Popery cried the raven Gordon for ever Grip cried Barnaby The raven placing his head upon the ground looked at his master sideways as though he would have said Say that again Perfectly understanding his desire Barnaby repeated the phrase a great many times The bird listened with profound attention sometimes repeating the popular cry in a low voice as if to compare the two and try if it would at all help him to this new accomplishment sometimes flapping his wings or barking and sometimes in a kind of desperation drawing a multitude of corks with extraordinary viciousness Barnaby was so intent upon his favourite that he was not at first aware of the approach of two persons on horseback who were riding at a foot pace and coming straight towards his post When he perceived them however which he did when they were within some fifty yards of him he jumped hastily up and ordering Grip within doors stood with both hands on his staff waiting until he should know whether they were friends or foes He had hardly done so when he observed that those who advanced were a gentleman and his servant almost at the same moment he recognised Lord George Gordon before whom he stood uncovered with his eyes turned towards the ground Good day said Lord George not reining in his horse until he was close beside him Well All quiet sir all safe cried Barnaby The rest are away they went by that path that one A grand party Ay said Lord George looking thoughtfully at him And you Oh They left me here to watch to mount guard to keep everything secure till they come back I ll do it sir for your sake You re a good gentleman a kind gentleman ay you are There are many against you but we ll be a match for them never fear What s that said Lord George pointing to the raven who was peeping out of the stable door but still looking thoughtfully and in some perplexity it seemed at Barnaby Why don t you know retorted Barnaby with a wondering laugh Not know what HE is A bird to be sure My bird my friend Grip A devil a kettle a Grip a Polly a Protestant no Popery cried the raven Though indeed added Barnaby laying his hand upon the neck of Lord George s horse and speaking softly you had good reason to ask me what he is for sometimes it puzzles me and I am used to him to think he s only a bird He s my brother Grip is always with me always talking always merry eh Grip The raven answered by an affectionate croak and hopping on his master s arm which he held downward for that purpose submitted with an air of perfect indifference to be fondled and turned his restless curious eye now upon Lord George and now upon his man Lord George biting his nails in a discomfited manner regarded Barnaby for some time in silence then beckoning to his servant said Come hither John John Grueby touched his hat and came Have you ever seen this young man before his master asked in a low voice Twice my lord said John I saw him in the crowd last night and Saturday Did did it seem to you that his manner was at all wild or strange Lord George demanded faltering Mad said John with emphatic brevity And why do you think him mad sir said his master speaking in a peevish tone Don t use that word too freely Why do you think him mad My lord John Grueby answered look at his dress look at his eyes look at his restless way hear him cry No Popery Mad my lord So because one man dresses unlike another returned his angry master glancing at himself and happens to differ from other men in his carriage and manner and to advocate a great cause which the corrupt and irreligious desert he is to be accounted mad is he Stark staring raving roaring mad my lord returned the unmoved John Do you say this to my face cried his master turning sharply upon him To any man my lord who asks me answered John Mr Gashford I find was right said Lord George I thought him prejudiced though I ought to have known a man like him better than to have supposed it possible I shall never have Mr Gashford s good word my lord replied John touching his hat respectfully and I don t covet it You are an ill conditioned most ungrateful fellow said Lord George a spy for anything I know Mr Gashford is perfectly correct as I might have felt convinced he was I have done wrong to retain you in my service It is a tacit insult to him as my choice and confidential friend to do so remembering the cause you sided with on the day he was maligned at Westminster You will leave me to night nay as soon as we reach home The sooner the better If it comes to that I say so too my lord Let Mr Gashford have his will As to my being a spy my lord you know me better than to believe it I am sure I don t know much about causes My cause is the cause of one man against two hundred and I hope it always will be You have said quite enough returned Lord George motioning him to go back I desire to hear no more If you ll let me have another word my lord returned John Grueby I d give this silly fellow a caution not to stay here by himself The proclamation is in a good many hands already and it s well known that he was concerned in the business it relates to He had better get to a place of safety if he can poor creature You hear what this man says cried Lord George addressing Barnaby who had looked on and wondered while this dialogue passed He thinks you may be afraid to remain upon your post and are kept here perhaps against your will What do you say I think young man said John in explanation that the soldiers may turn out and take you and that if they do you will certainly be hung by the neck till you re dead dead dead And I think you had better go from here as fast as you can That s what I think He s a coward Grip a coward cried Barnaby putting the raven on the ground and shouldering his staff Let them come Gordon for ever Let them come Ay said Lord George let them Let us see who will venture to attack a power like ours the solemn league of a whole people THIS a madman You have said well very well I am proud to be the leader of such men as you Bamaby s heart swelled within his bosom as he heard these words He took Lord George s hand and carried it to his lips patted his horse s crest as if the affection and admiration he had conceived for the man extended to the animal he rode then unfurling his flag and proudly waving it resumed his pacing up and down Lord George with a kindling eye and glowing cheek took off his hat and flourishing it above his head bade him exultingly Farewell then cantered off at a brisk pace after glancing angrily round to see that his servant followed Honest John set spurs to his horse and rode after his master but not before he had again warned Barnaby to retreat with many significant gestures which indeed he continued to make and Barnaby to resist until the windings of the road concealed them from each other s view Left to himself again with a still higher sense of the importance of his post and stimulated to enthusiasm by the special notice and encouragement of his leader Barnaby walked to and fro in a delicious trance rather than as a waking man The sunshine which prevailed around was in his mind He had but one desire ungratified If she could only see him now The day wore on its heat was gently giving place to the cool of evening a light wind sprung up fanning his long hair and making the banner rustle pleasantly above his head There was a freedom and freshness in the sound and in the time which chimed exactly with his mood He was happier than ever He was leaning on his staff looking towards the declining sun and reflecting with a smile that he stood sentinel at that moment over buried gold when two or three figures appeared in the distance making towards the house at a rapid pace and motioning with their hands as though they urged its inmates to retreat from some approaching danger As they drew nearer they became more earnest in their gestures and they were no sooner within hearing than the foremost among them cried that the soldiers were coming up At these words Barnaby furled his flag and tied it round the pole His heart beat high while he did so but he had no more fear or thought of retreating than the pole itself The friendly stragglers hurried past him after giving him notice of his danger and quickly passed into the house where the utmost confusion immediately prevailed As those within hastily closed the windows and the doors they urged him by looks and signs to fly without loss of time and called to him many times to do so but he only shook his head indignantly in answer and stood the firmer on his post Finding that he was not to be persuaded they took care of themselves and leaving the place with only one old woman in it speedily withdrew As yet there had been no symptom of the news having any better foundation than in the fears of those who brought it but The Boot had not been deserted five minutes when there appeared coming across the fields a body of men who it was easy to see by the glitter of their arms and ornaments in the sun and by their orderly and regular mode of advancing for they came on as one man were soldiers In a very little time Barnaby knew that they were a strong detachment of the Foot Guards having along with them two gentlemen in private clothes and a small party of Horse the latter brought up the rear and were not in number more than six or eight They advanced steadily neither quickening their pace as they came nearer nor raising any cry nor showing the least emotion or anxiety Though this was a matter of course in the case of regular troops even to Barnaby there was something particularly impressive and disconcerting in it to one accustomed to the noise and tumult of an undisciplined mob For all that he stood his ground not a whit the less resolutely and looked on undismayed Presently they marched into the yard and halted The commanding officer despatched a messenger to the horsemen one of whom came riding back Some words passed between them and they glanced at Barnaby who well remembered the man he had unhorsed at Westminster and saw him now before his eyes The man being speedily dismissed saluted and rode back to his comrades who were drawn up apart at a short distance The officer then gave the word to prime and load The heavy ringing of the musket stocks upon the ground and the sharp and rapid rattling of the ramrods in their barrels were a kind of relief to Batnahy deadly though he knew the purport of such sounds to be When this was done other commands were given and the soldiers instantaneously formed in single file all round the house and stables completely encircling them in every part at a distance perhaps of some half dozen yards at least that seemed in Barnaby s eyes to be about the space left between himself and those who confronted him The horsemen remained drawn up by themselves as before The two gentlemen in private clothes who had kept aloof now rode forward one on either side the officer The proclamation having been produced and read by one of them the officer called on Barnaby to surrender He made no answer but stepping within the door before which he had kept guard held his pole crosswise to protect it In the midst of a profound silence he was again called upon to yield Still he offered no reply Indeed he had enough to do to run his eye backward and forward along the half dozen men who immediately fronted him and settle hurriedly within himself at which of them he would strike first when they pressed on him He caught the eye of one in the centre and resolved to hew that fellow down though he died for it Again there was a dead silence and again the same voice called upon him to deliver himself up Next moment he was back in the stable dealing blows about him like a madman Two of the men lay stretched at his feet the one he had marked dropped first he had a thought for that even in the hot blood and hurry of the struggle Another blow another Down mastered wounded in the breast by a heavy blow from the butt end of a gun he saw the weapon in the act of falling breathless and a prisoner An exclamation of surprise from the officer recalled him in some degree to himself He looked round Grip after working in secret all the afternoon and with redoubled vigour while everybody s attention was distracted had plucked away the straw from Hugh s bed and turned up the loose ground with his iron bill The hole had been recklessly filled to the brim and was merely sprinkled with earth Golden cups spoons candlesticks coined guineas all the riches were revealed They brought spades and a sack dug up everything that was hidden there and carried away more than two men could lift They handcuffed him and bound his arms searched him and took away all he had Nobody questioned or reproached him or seemed to have much curiosity about him The two men he had stunned were carried off by their companions in the same business like way in which everything else was done Finally he was left under a guard of four soldiers with fixed bayonets while the officer directed in person the search of the house and the other buildings connected with it This was soon completed The soldiers formed again in the yard he was marched out with his guard about him and ordered to fall in where a space was left The others closed up all round and so they moved away with the prisoner in the centre When they came into the streets he felt he was a sight and looking up as they passed quickly along could see people running to the windows a little too late and throwing up the sashes to look after him Sometimes he met a staring face beyond the heads about him or under the arms of his conductors or peering down upon him from a waggon top or coach box but this was all he saw being surrounded by so many men The very noises of the streets seemed muffled and subdued and the air came stale and hot upon him like the sickly breath of an oven Tramp tramp Tramp tramp Heads erect shoulders square every man stepping in exact time all so orderly and regular nobody looking at him nobody seeming conscious of his presence he could hardly believe he was a Prisoner But at the word though only thought not spoken he felt the handcuffs galling his wrists the cord pressing his arms to his sides the loaded guns levelled at his head and those cold bright sharp shining points turned towards him the mere looking down at which now that he was bound and helpless made the warm current of his life run cold Chapter 58 They were not long in reaching the barracks for the officer who commanded the party was desirous to avoid rousing the people by the display of military force in the streets and was humanely anxious to give as little opportunity as possible for any attempt at rescue knowing that it must lead to bloodshed and loss of life and that if the civil authorities by whom he was accompanied empowered him to order his men to fire many innocent persons would probably fall whom curiosity or idleness had attracted to the spot He therefore led the party briskly on avoiding with a merciful prudence the more public and crowded thoroughfares and pursuing those which he deemed least likely to be infested by disorderly persons This wise proceeding not only enabled them to gain their quarters without any interruption but completely baffled a body of rioters who had assembled in one of the main streets through which it was considered certain they would pass and who remained gathered together for the purpose of releasing the prisoner from their hands long after they had deposited him in a place of security closed the barrack gates and set a double guard at every entrance for its better protection Arrived at this place poor Barnaby was marched into a stone floored room where there was a very powerful smell of tobacco a strong thorough draught of air and a great wooden bedstead large enough for a score of men Several soldiers in undress were lounging about or eating from tin cans military accoutrements dangled on rows of pegs along the whitewashed wall and some half dozen men lay fast asleep upon their backs snoring in concert After remaining here just long enough to note these things he was marched out again and conveyed across the parade ground to another portion of the building Perhaps a man never sees so much at a glance as when he is in a situation of extremity The chances are a hundred to one that if Barnaby had lounged in at the gate to look about him he would have lounged out again with a very imperfect idea of the place and would have remembered very little about it But as he was taken handcuffed across the gravelled area nothing escaped his notice The dry arid look of the dusty square and of the bare brick building the clothes hanging at some of the windows and the men in their shirt sleeves and braces lolling with half their bodies out of the others the green sun blinds at the officers quarters and the little scanty trees in front the drummer boys practising in a distant courtyard the men at drill on the parade the two soldiers carrying a basket between them who winked to each other as he went by and slily pointed to their throats the spruce serjeant who hurried past with a cane in his hand and under his arm a clasped book with a vellum cover the fellows in the ground floor rooms furbishing and brushing up their different articles of dress who stopped to look at him and whose voices as they spoke together echoed loudly through the empty galleries and passages everything down to the stand of muskets before the guard house and the drum with a pipe clayed belt attached in one corner impressed itself upon his observation as though he had noticed them in the same place a hundred times or had been a whole day among them in place of one brief hurried minute He was taken into a small paved back yard and there they opened a great door plated with iron and pierced some five feet above the ground with a few holes to let in air and light Into this dungeon he was walked straightway and having locked him up there and placed a sentry over him they left him to his meditations The cell or black hole for it had those words painted on the door was very dark and having recently accommodated a drunken deserter by no means clean Barnaby felt his way to some straw at the farther end and looking towards the door tried to accustom himself to the gloom which coming from the bright sunshine out of doors was not an easy task There was a kind of portico or colonnade outside and this obstructed even the little light that at the best could have found its way through the small apertures in the door The footsteps of the sentinel echoed monotonously as he paced its stone pavement to and fro reminding Barnaby of the watch he had so lately kept himself and as he passed and repassed the door he made the cell for an instant so black by the interposition of his body that his going away again seemed like the appearance of a new ray of light and was quite a circumstance to look for When the prisoner had sat sometime upon the ground gazing at the chinks and listening to the advancing and receding footsteps of his guard the man stood still upon his post Barnaby quite unable to think or to speculate on what would be done with him had been lulled into a kind of doze by his regular pace but his stopping roused him and then he became aware that two men were in conversation under the colonnade and very near the door of his cell How long they had been talking there he could not tell for he had fallen into an unconsciousness of his real position and when the footsteps ceased was answering aloud some question which seemed to have been put to him by Hugh in the stable though of the fancied purport either of question or reply notwithstanding that he awoke with the latter on his lips he had no recollection whatever The first words that reached his ears were these Why is he brought here then if he has to be taken away again so soon Why where would you have him go Damme he s not as safe anywhere as among the king s troops is he What WOULD you do with him Would you hand him over to a pack of cowardly civilians that shake in their shoes till they wear the soles out with trembling at the threats of the ragamuffins he belongs to That s true enough True enough I ll tell you what I wish Tom Green that I was a commissioned instead of a non commissioned officer and that I had the command of two companies only two companies of my own regiment Call me out to stop these riots give me the needful authority and half a dozen rounds of ball cartridge Ay said the other voice That s all very well but they won t give the needful authority If the magistrate won t give the word what s the officer to do Not very well knowing as it seemed how to overcome this difficulty the other man contented himself with damning the magistrates With all my heart said his friend Where s the use of a magistrate returned the other voice What s a magistrate in this case but an impertinent unnecessary unconstitutional sort of interference Here s a proclamation Here s a man referred to in that proclamation Here s proof against him and a witness on the spot Damme Take him out and shoot him sir Who wants a magistrate When does he go before Sir John Fielding asked the man who had spoken first To night at eight o clock returned the other Mark what follows The magistrate commits him to Newgate Our people take him to Newgate The rioters pelt our people Our people retire before the rioters Stones are thrown insults are offered not a shot s fired Why Because of the magistrates Damn the magistrates When he had in some degree relieved his mind by cursing the magistrates in various other forms of speech the man was silent save for a low growling still having reference to those authorities which from time to time escaped him Barnaby who had wit enough to know that this conversation concerned and very nearly concerned himself remained perfectly quiet until they ceased to speak when he groped his way to the door and peeping through the air holes tried to make out what kind of men they were to whom he had been listening The one who condemned the civil power in such strong terms was a serjeant engaged just then as the streaming ribands in his cap announced on the recruiting service He stood leaning sideways against a pillar nearly opposite the door and as he growled to himself drew figures on the pavement with his cane The other man had his back towards the dungeon and Barnaby could only see his form To judge from that he was a gallant manly handsome fellow but he had lost his left arm It had been taken off between the elbow and the shoulder and his empty coat sleeve hung across his breast It was probably this circumstance which gave him an interest beyond any that his companion could boast of and attracted Barnaby s attention There was something soldierly in his bearing and he wore a jaunty cap and jacket Perhaps he had been in the service at one time or other If he had it could not have been very long ago for he was but a young fellow now Well well he said thoughtfully let the fault be where it may it makes a man sorrowful to come back to old England and see her in this condition I suppose the pigs will join em next said the serjeant with an imprecation on the rioters now that the birds have set em the example The birds repeated Tom Green Ah birds said the serjeant testily that s English an t it I don t know what you mean Go to the guard house and see You ll find a bird there that s got their cry as pat as any of em and bawls No Popery like a man or like a devil as he says he is I shouldn t wonder The devil s loose in London somewhere Damme if I wouldn t twist his neck round on the chance if I had MY way The young man had taken two or three steps away as if to go and see this creature when he was arrested by the voice of Barnaby It s mine he called out half laughing and half weeping my pet my friend Grip Ha ha ha Don t hurt him he has done no harm I taught him it s my fault Let me have him if you please He s the only friend I have left now He ll not dance or talk or whistle for you I know but he will for me because he knows me and loves me though you wouldn t think it very well You wouldn t hurt a bird I m sure You re a brave soldier sir and wouldn t harm a woman or a child no no nor a poor bird I m certain This latter adjuration was addressed to the serjeant whom Barnaby judged from his red coat to be high in office and able to seal Grip s destiny by a word But that gentleman in reply surlily damned him for a thief and rebel as he was and with many disinterested imprecations on his own eyes liver blood and body assured him that if it rested with him to decide he would put a final stopper on the bird and his master too You talk boldly to a caged man said Barnaby in anger If I was on the other side of the door and there were none to part us you d change your note ay you may toss your head you would Kill the bird do Kill anything you can and so revenge yourself on those who with their bare hands untied could do as much to you Having vented his defiance he flung himself into the furthest corner of his prison and muttering Good bye Grip good bye dear old Grip shed tears for the first time since he had been taken captive and hid his face in the straw He had had some fancy at first that the one armed man would help him or would give him a kind word in answer He hardly knew why but he hoped and thought so The young fellow had stopped when he called out and checking himself in the very act of turning round stood listening to every word he said Perhaps he built his feeble trust on this perhaps on his being young and having a frank and honest manner However that might be he built on sand The other went away directly he had finished speaking and neither answered him nor returned No matter They were all against him here he might have known as much Good bye old Grip good bye After some time they came and unlocked the door and called to him to come out He rose directly and complied for he would not have THEM think he was subdued or frightened He walked out like a man and looked from face to face None of them returned his gaze or seemed to notice it They marched him back to the parade by the way they had brought him and there they halted among a body of soldiers at least twice as numerous as that which had taken him prisoner in the afternoon The officer he had seen before bade him in a few brief words take notice that if he attempted to escape no matter how favourable a chance he might suppose he had certain of the men had orders to fire upon him that moment They then closed round him as before and marched him off again In the same unbroken order they arrived at Bow Street followed and beset on all sides by a crowd which was continually increasing Here he was placed before a blind gentleman and asked if he wished to say anything Not he What had he got to tell them After a very little talking which he was careless of and quite indifferent to they told him he was to go to Newgate and took him away He went out into the street so surrounded and hemmed in on every side by soldiers that he could see nothing but he knew there was a great crowd of people by the murmur and that they were not friendly to the soldiers was soon rendered evident by their yells and hisses How often and how eagerly he listened for the voice of Hugh There was not a voice he knew among them all Was Hugh a prisoner too Was there no hope As they came nearer and nearer to the prison the hootings of the people grew more violent stones were thrown and every now and then a rush was made against the soldiers which they staggered under One of them close before him smarting under a blow upon the temple levelled his musket but the officer struck it upwards with his sword and ordered him on peril of his life to desist This was the last thing he saw with any distinctness for directly afterwards he was tossed about and beaten to and fro as though in a tempestuous sea But go where he would there were the same guards about him Twice or thrice he was thrown down and so were they but even then he could not elude their vigilance for a moment They were up again and had closed about him before he with his wrists so tightly bound could scramble to his feet Fenced in thus he felt himself hoisted to the top of a low flight of steps and then for a moment he caught a glimpse of the fighting in the crowd and of a few red coats sprinkled together here and there struggling to rejoin their fellows Next moment everything was dark and gloomy and he was standing in the prison lobby the centre of a group of men A smith was speedily in attendance who riveted upon him a set of heavy irons Stumbling on as well as he could beneath the unusual burden of these fetters he was conducted to a strong stone cell where fastening the door with locks and bolts and chains they left him well secured having first unseen by him thrust in Grip who with his head drooping and his deep black plumes rough and rumpled appeared to comprehend and to partake his master s fallen fortunes Chapter 59 It is necessary at this juncture to return to Hugh who having as we have seen called to the rioters to disperse from about the Warren and meet again as usual glided back into the darkness from which he had emerged and reappeared no more that night He paused in the copse which sheltered him from the observation of his mad companions and waited to ascertain whether they drew off at his bidding or still lingered and called to him to join them Some few he saw were indisposed to go away without him and made towards the spot where he stood concealed as though they were about to follow in his footsteps and urge him to come back but these men being in their turn called to by their friends and in truth not greatly caring to venture into the dark parts of the grounds where they might be easily surprised and taken if any of the neighbours or retainers of the family were watching them from among the trees soon abandoned the idea and hastily assembling such men as they found of their mind at the moment straggled off When he was satisfied that the great mass of the insurgents were imitating this example and that the ground was rapidly clearing he plunged into the thickest portion of the little wood and crashing the branches as he went made straight towards a distant light guided by that and by the sullen glow of the fire behind him As he drew nearer and nearer to the twinkling beacon towards which he bent his course the red glare of a few torches began to reveal itself and the voices of men speaking together in a subdued tone broke the silence which save for a distant shouting now and then already prevailed At length he cleared the wood and springing across a ditch stood in a dark lane where a small body of ill looking vagabonds whom he had left there some twenty minutes before waited his coming with impatience They were gathered round an old post chaise or chariot driven by one of themselves who sat postilion wise upon the near horse The blinds were drawn up and Mr Tappertit and Dennis kept guard at the two windows The former assumed the command of the party for he challenged Hugh as he advanced towards them and when he did so those who were resting on the ground about the carriage rose to their feet and clustered round him Well said Simon in a low voice is all right Right enough replied Hugh in the same tone They re dispersing now had begun before I came away And is the coast clear Clear enough before our men I take it said Hugh There are not many who knowing of their work over yonder will want to meddle with em to night Who s got some drink here Everybody had some plunder from the cellar half a dozen flasks and bottles were offered directly He selected the largest and putting it to his mouth sent the wine gurgling down his throat Having emptied it he threw it down and stretched out his hand for another which he emptied likewise at a draught Another was given him and this he half emptied too Reserving what remained to finish with he asked Have you got anything to eat any of you I m as ravenous as a hungry wolf Which of you was in the larder come I was brother said Dennis pulling off his hat and fumbling in the crown There s a matter of cold venison pasty somewhere or another here if that ll do Do cried Hugh seating himself on the pathway Bring it out Quick Show a light here and gather round Let me sup in state my lads Ha ha ha Entering into his boisterous humour for they all had drunk deeply and were as wild as he they crowded about him while two of their number who had torches held them up one on either side of him that his banquet might not be despatched in the dark Mr Dennis having by this time succeeded in extricating from his hat a great mass of pasty which had been wedged in so tightly that it was not easily got out put it before him and Hugh having borrowed a notched and jagged knife from one of the company fell to work upon it vigorously I should recommend you to swallow a little fire every day about an hour afore dinner brother said Dennis after a pause It seems to agree with you and to stimulate your appetite Hugh looked at him and at the blackened faces by which he was surrounded and stopping for a moment to flourish his knife above his head answered with a roar of laughter Keep order there will you said Simon Tappertit Why isn t a man allowed to regale himself noble captain retorted his lieutenant parting the men who stood between them with his knife that he might see him to regale himself a little bit after such work as mine What a hard captain What a strict captain What a tyrannical captain Ha ha ha I wish one of you fellers would hold a bottle to his mouth to keep him quiet said Simon unless you want the military to be down upon us And what if they are down upon us retorted Hugh Who cares Who s afraid Let em come I say let em come The more the merrier Give me bold Barnaby at my side and we two will settle the military without troubling any of you Barnaby s the man for the military Barnaby s health But as the majority of those present were by no means anxious for a second engagement that night being already weary and exhausted they sided with Mr Tappertit and pressed him to make haste with his supper for they had already delayed too long Knowing even in the height of his frenzy that they incurred great danger by lingering so near the scene of the late outrages Hugh made an end of his meal without more remonstrance and rising stepped up to Mr Tappertit and smote him on the back Now then he cried I m ready There are brave birds inside this cage eh Delicate birds tender loving little doves I caged em I caged em one more peep He thrust the little man aside as he spoke and mounting on the steps which were half let down pulled down the blind by force and stared into the chaise like an ogre into his larder Ha ha ha and did you scratch and pinch and struggle pretty mistress he cried as he grasped a little hand that sought in vain to free itself from his grip you so bright eyed and cherry lipped and daintily made But I love you better for it mistress Ay I do You should stab me and welcome so that it pleased you and you had to cure me afterwards I love to see you proud and scornful It makes you handsomer than ever and who so handsome as you at any time my pretty one Come said Mr Tappertit who had waited during this speech with considerable impatience There s enough of that Come down The little hand seconded this admonition by thrusting Hugh s great head away with all its force and drawing up the blind amidst his noisy laughter and vows that he must have another look for the last glimpse of that sweet face had provoked him past all bearing However as the suppressed impatience of the party now broke out into open murmurs he abandoned this design and taking his seat upon the bar contented himself with tapping at the front windows of the carriage and trying to steal a glance inside Mr Tappertit mounting the steps and hanging on by the door issued his directions to the driver with a commanding voice and attitude the rest got up behind or ran by the side of the carriage as they could some in imitation of Hugh endeavoured to see the face he had praised so highly and were reminded of their impertinence by hints from the cudgel of Mr Tappertit Thus they pursued their journey by circuitous and winding roads preserving except when they halted to take breath or to quarrel about the best way of reaching London pretty good order and tolerable silence In the mean time Dolly beautiful bewitching captivating little Dolly her hair dishevelled her dress torn her dark eyelashes wet with tears her bosom heaving her face now pale with fear now crimsoned with indignation her whole self a hundred times more beautiful in this heightened aspect than ever she had been before vainly strove to comfort Emma Haredale and to impart to her the consolation of which she stood in so much need herself The soldiers were sure to come they must be rescued it would be impossible to convey them through the streets of London when they set the threats of their guards at defiance and shrieked to the passengers for help If they did this when they came into the more frequented ways she was certain she was quite certain they must be released So poor Dolly said and so poor Dolly tried to think but the invariable conclusion of all such arguments was that Dolly burst into tears cried as she wrung her hands what would they do or think or who would comfort them at home at the Golden Key and sobbed most piteously Miss Haredale whose feelings were usually of a quieter kind than Dolly s and not so much upon the surface was dreadfully alarmed and indeed had only just recovered from a swoon She was very pale and the hand which Dolly held was quite cold but she bade her nevertheless remember that under Providence much must depend upon their own discretion that if they remained quiet and lulled the vigilance of the ruffians into whose hands they had fallen the chances of their being able to procure assistance when they reached the town were very much increased that unless society were quite unhinged a hot pursuit must be immediately commenced and that her uncle she might be sure would never rest until he had found them out and rescued them But as she said these latter words the idea that he had fallen in a general massacre of the Catholics that night no very wild or improbable supposition after what they had seen and undergone struck her dumb and lost in the horrors they had witnessed and those they might be yet reserved for she sat incapable of thought or speech or outward show of grief as rigid and almost as white and cold as marble Oh how many many times in that long ride did Dolly think of her old lover poor fond slighted Joe How many many times did she recall that night when she ran into his arms from the very man now projecting his hateful gaze into the darkness where she sat and leering through the glass in monstrous admiration And when she thought of Joe and what a brave fellow he was and how he would have rode boldly up and dashed in among these villains now yes though they were double the number and here she clenched her little hand and pressed her foot upon the ground the pride she felt for a moment in having won his heart faded in a burst of tears and she sobbed more bitterly than ever As the night wore on and they proceeded by ways which were quite unknown to them for they could recognise none of the objects of which they sometimes caught a hurried glimpse their fears increased nor were they without good foundation it was not difficult for two beautiful young women to find in their being borne they knew not whither by a band of daring villains who eyed them as some among these fellows did reasons for the worst alarm When they at last entered London by a suburb with which they were wholly unacquainted it was past midnight and the streets were dark and empty Nor was this the worst for the carriage stopping in a lonely spot Hugh suddenly opened the door jumped in and took his seat between them It was in vain they cried for help He put his arm about the neck of each and swore to stifle them with kisses if they were not as silent as the grave I come here to keep you quiet he said and that s the means I shall take So don t be quiet pretty mistresses make a noise do and I shall like it all the better They were proceeding at a rapid pace and apparently with fewer attendants than before though it was so dark the torches being extinguished that this was mere conjecture They shrunk from his touch each into the farthest corner of the carriage but shrink as Dolly would his arm encircled her waist and held her fast She neither cried nor spoke for terror and disgust deprived her of the power but she plucked at his hand as though she would die in the effort to disengage herself and crouching on the ground with her head averted and held down repelled him with a strength she wondered at as much as he The carriage stopped again Lift this one out said Hugh to the man who opened the door as he took Miss Haredale s hand and felt how heavily it fell She s fainted So much the better growled Dennis it was that amiable gentleman She s quiet I always like em to faint unless they re very tender and composed Can you take her by yourself asked Hugh I don t know till I try I ought to be able to I ve lifted up a good many in my time said the hangman Up then She s no small weight brother none of these here fine gals are Up again Now we have her Having by this time hoisted the young lady into his arms he staggered off with his burden Look ye pretty bird said Hugh drawing Dolly towards him Remember what I told you a kiss for every cry Scream if you love me darling Scream once mistress Pretty mistress only once if you love me Thrusting his face away with all her force and holding down her head Dolly submitted to be carried out of the chaise and borne after Miss Haredale into a miserable cottage where Hugh after hugging her to his breast set her gently down upon the floor Poor Dolly Do what she would she only looked the better for it and tempted them the more When her eyes flashed angrily and her ripe lips slightly parted to give her rapid breathing vent who could resist it When she wept and sobbed as though her heart would break and bemoaned her miseries in the sweetest voice that ever fell upon a listener s ear who could be insensible to the little winning pettishness which now and then displayed itself even in the sincerity and earnestness of her grief When forgetful for a moment of herself as she was now she fell on her knees beside her friend and bent over her and laid her cheek to hers and put her arms about her what mortal eyes could have avoided wandering to the delicate bodice the streaming hair the neglected dress the perfect abandonment and unconsciousness of the blooming little beauty Who could look on and see her lavish caresses and endearments and not desire to be in Emma Haredale s place to be either her or Dolly either the hugging or the hugged Not Hugh Not Dennis I tell you what it is young women said Mr Dennis I an t much of a lady s man myself nor am I a party in the present business further than lending a willing hand to my friends but if I see much more of this here sort of thing I shall become a principal instead of a accessory I tell you candid Why have you brought us here said Emma Are we to be murdered Murdered cried Dennis sitting down upon a stool and regarding her with great favour Why my dear who d murder sich chickabiddies as you If you was to ask me now whether you was brought here to be married there might be something in it And here he exchanged a grin with Hugh who removed his eyes from Dolly for the purpose No no said Dennis there ll be no murdering my pets Nothing of that sort Quite the contrairy You are an older man than your companion sir said Emma trembling Have you no pity for us Do you not consider that we are women I do indeed my dear retorted Dennis It would be very hard not to with two such specimens afore my eyes Ha ha Oh yes I consider that We all consider that miss He shook his head waggishly leered at Hugh again and laughed very much as if he had said a noble thing and rather thought he was coming out There ll be no murdering my dear Not a bit on it I tell you what though brother said Dennis cocking his hat for the convenience of scratching his head and looking gravely at Hugh it s worthy of notice as a proof of the amazing equalness and dignity of our law that it don t make no distinction between men and women I ve heerd the judge say sometimes to a highwayman or housebreaker as had tied the ladies neck and heels you ll excuse me making mention of it my darlings and put em in a cellar that he showed no consideration to women Now I say that there judge didn t know his business brother and that if I had been that there highwayman or housebreaker I should have made answer What are you a talking of my lord I showed the women as much consideration as the law does and what more would you have me do If you was to count up in the newspapers the number of females as have been worked off in this here city alone in the last ten year said Mr Dennis thoughtfully you d be surprised at the total quite amazed you would There s a dignified and equal thing a beautiful thing But we ve no security for its lasting Now that they ve begun to favour these here Papists I shouldn t wonder if they went and altered even THAT one of these days Upon my soul I shouldn t The subject perhaps from being of too exclusive and professional a nature failed to interest Hugh as much as his friend had anticipated But he had no time to pursue it for at this crisis Mr Tappertit entered precipitately at sight of whom Dolly uttered a scream of joy and fairly threw herself into his arms I knew it I was sure of it cried Dolly My dear father s at the door Thank God thank God Bless you Sim Heaven bless you for this Simon Tappertit who had at first implicitly believed that the locksmith s daughter unable any longer to suppress her secret passion for himself was about to give it full vent in its intensity and to declare that she was his for ever looked extremely foolish when she said these words the more so as they were received by Hugh and Dennis with a loud laugh which made her draw back and regard him with a fixed and earnest look Miss Haredale said Sim after a very awkward silence I hope you re as comfortable as circumstances will permit of Dolly Varden my darling my own my lovely one I hope YOU RE pretty comfortable likewise Poor little Dolly She saw how it was hid her face in her hands and sobbed more bitterly than ever You meet in me Miss V said Simon laying his hand upon his breast not a prentice not a workman not a slave not the wictim of your father s tyrannical behaviour but the leader of a great people the captain of a noble band in which these gentlemen are as I may say corporals and serjeants You behold in me not a private individual but a public character not a mender of locks but a healer of the wounds of his unhappy country Dolly V sweet Dolly V for how many years have I looked forward to this present meeting For how many years has it been my intention to exalt and ennoble you I redeem it Behold in me your husband Yes beautiful Dolly charmer enslaver S Tappertit is all your own As he said these words he advanced towards her Dolly retreated till she could go no farther and then sank down upon the floor Thinking it very possible that this might be maiden modesty Simon essayed to raise her on which Dolly goaded to desperation wound her hands in his hair and crying out amidst her tears that he was a dreadful little wretch and always had been shook and pulled and beat him until he was fain to call for help most lustily Hugh had never admired her half so much as at that moment She s in an excited state to night said Simon as he smoothed his rumpled feathers and don t know when she s well off Let her be by herself till to morrow and that ll bring her down a little Carry her into the next house Hugh had her in his arms directly It might be that Mr Tappertit s heart was really softened by her distress or it might be that he felt it in some degree indecorous that his intended bride should be struggling in the grasp of another man He commanded him on second thoughts to put her down again and looked moodily on as she flew to Miss Haredale s side and clinging to her dress hid her flushed face in its folds They shall remain here together till to morrow said Simon who had now quite recovered his dignity till to morrow Come away Ay cried Hugh Come away captain Ha ha ha What are you laughing at demanded Simon sternly Nothing captain nothing Hugh rejoined and as he spoke and clapped his hand upon the shoulder of the little man he laughed again for some unknown reason with tenfold violence Mr Tappertit surveyed him from head to foot with lofty scorn this only made him laugh the more and turning to the prisoners said You ll take notice ladies that this place is well watched on every side and that the least noise is certain to be attended with unpleasant consequences You ll hear both of you more of our intentions to morrow In the mean time don t show yourselves at the window or appeal to any of the people you may see pass it for if you do it ll be known directly that you come from a Catholic house and all the exertions our men can make may not be able to save your lives With this last caution which was true enough he turned to the door followed by Hugh and Dennis They paused for a moment going out to look at them clasped in each other s arms and then left the cottage fastening the door and setting a good watch upon it and indeed all round the house I say growled Dennis as they walked away in company that s a dainty pair Muster Gashford s one is as handsome as the other eh Hush said Hugh hastily Don t you mention names It s a bad habit I wouldn t like to be HIM then as you don t like names when he breaks it out to her that s all said Dennis She s one of them fine black eyed proud gals as I wouldn t trust at such times with a knife too near em I ve seen some of that sort afore now I recollect one that was worked off many year ago and there was a gentleman in that case too that says to me with her lip a trembling but her hand as steady as ever I see one Dennis I m near my end but if I had a dagger in these fingers and he was within my reach I d strike him dead afore me ah she did and she d have done it too Strike who dead demanded Hugh How should I know brother answered Dennis SHE never said not she Hugh looked for a moment as though he would have made some further inquiry into this incoherent recollection but Simon Tappertit who had been meditating deeply gave his thoughts a new direction Hugh said Sim You have done well to day You shall be rewarded So have you Dennis There s no young woman YOU want to carry off is there N no returned that gentleman stroking his grizzly beard which was some two inches long None in partickler I think Very good said Sim then we ll find some other way of making it up to you As to you old boy he turned to Hugh you shall have Miggs her that I promised you you know within three days Mind I pass my word for it Hugh thanked him heartily and as he did so his laughing fit returned with such violence that he was obliged to hold his side with one hand and to lean with the other on the shoulder of his small captain without whose support he would certainly have rolled upon the ground Chapter 60 The three worthies turned their faces towards The Boot with the intention of passing the night in that place of rendezvous and of seeking the repose they so much needed in the shelter of their old den for now that the mischief and destruction they had purposed were achieved and their prisoners were safely bestowed for the night they began to be conscious of exhaustion and to feel the wasting effects of the madness which had led to such deplorable results Notwithstanding the lassitude and fatigue which oppressed him now in common with his two companions and indeed with all who had taken an active share in that night s work Hugh s boisterous merriment broke out afresh whenever he looked at Simon Tappertit and vented itself much to that gentleman s indignation in such shouts of laughter as bade fair to bring the watch upon them and involve them in a skirmish to which in their present worn out condition they might prove by no means equal Even Mr Dennis who was not at all particular on the score of gravity or dignity and who had a great relish for his young friend s eccentric humours took occasion to remonstrate with him on this imprudent behaviour which he held to be a species of suicide tantamount to a man s working himself off without being overtaken by the law than which he could imagine nothing more ridiculous or impertinent Not abating one jot of his noisy mirth for these remonstrances Hugh reeled along between them having an arm of each until they hove in sight of The Boot and were within a field or two of that convenient tavern He happened by great good luck to have roared and shouted himself into silence by this time They were proceeding onward without noise when a scout who had been creeping about the ditches all night to warn any stragglers from encroaching further on what was now such dangerous ground peeped cautiously from his hiding place and called to them to stop Stop and why said Hugh Because the scout replied the house was filled with constables and soldiers having been surprised that afternoon The inmates had fled or been taken into custody he could not say which He had prevented a great many people from approaching nearer and he believed they had gone to the markets and such places to pass the night He had seen the distant fires but they were all out now He had heard the people who passed and repassed speaking of them too and could report that the prevailing opinion was one of apprehension and dismay He had not heard a word of Barnaby didn t even know his name but it had been said in his hearing that some man had been taken and carried off to Newgate Whether this was true or false he could not affirm The three took counsel together on hearing this and debated what it might be best to do Hugh deeming it possible that Barnaby was in the hands of the soldiers and at that moment under detention at The Boot was for advancing stealthily and firing the house but his companions who objected to such rash measures unless they had a crowd at their backs represented that if Barnaby were taken he had assuredly been removed to a stronger prison they would never have dreamed of keeping him all night in a place so weak and open to attack Yielding to this reasoning and to their persuasions Hugh consented to turn back and to repair to Fleet Market for which place it seemed a few of their boldest associates had shaped their course on receiving the same intelligence Feeling their strength recruited and their spirits roused now that there was a new necessity for action they hurried away quite forgetful of the fatigue under which they had been sinking but a few minutes before and soon arrived at their new place of destination Fleet Market at that time was a long irregular row of wooden sheds and penthouses occupying the centre of what is now called Farringdon Street They were jumbled together in a most unsightly fashion in the middle of the road to the great obstruction of the thoroughfare and the annoyance of passengers who were fain to make their way as they best could among carts baskets barrows trucks casks bulks and benches and to jostle with porters hucksters waggoners and a motley crowd of buyers sellers pick pockets vagrants and idlers The air was perfumed with the stench of rotten leaves and faded fruit the refuse of the butchers stalls and offal and garbage of a hundred kinds It was indispensable to most public conveniences in those days that they should be public nuisances likewise and Fleet Market maintained the principle to admiration To this place perhaps because its sheds and baskets were a tolerable substitute for beds or perhaps because it afforded the means of a hasty barricade in case of need many of the rioters had straggled not only that night but for two or three nights before It was now broad day but the morning being cold a group of them were gathered round a fire in a public house drinking hot purl and smoking pipes and planning new schemes for to morrow Hugh and his two friends being known to most of these men were received with signal marks of approbation and inducted into the most honourable seats The room door was closed and fastened to keep intruders at a distance and then they proceeded to exchange news The soldiers have taken possession of The Boot I hear said Hugh Who knows anything about it Several cried that they did but the majority of the company having been engaged in the assault upon the Warren and all present having been concerned in one or other of the night s expeditions it proved that they knew no more than Hugh himself having been merely warned by each other or by the scout and knowing nothing of their own knowledge We left a man on guard there to day said Hugh looking round him who is not here You know who it is Barnaby who brought the soldier down at Westminster Has any man seen or heard of him They shook their heads and murmured an answer in the negative as each man looked round and appealed to his fellow when a noise was heard without and a man was heard to say that he wanted Hugh that he must see Hugh He is but one man cried Hugh to those who kept the door let him come in Ay ay muttered the others Let him come in Let him come in The door was accordingly unlocked and opened A one armed man with his head and face tied up with a bloody cloth as though he had been severely beaten his clothes torn and his remaining hand grasping a thick stick rushed in among them and panting for breath demanded which was Hugh Here he is replied the person he inquired for I am Hugh What do you want with me I have a message for you said the man You know one Barnaby What of him Did he send the message Yes He s taken He s in one of the strong cells in Newgate He defended himself as well as he could but was overpowered by numbers That s his message When did you see him asked Hugh hastily On his way to prison where he was taken by a party of soldiers They took a by road and not the one we expected I was one of the few who tried to rescue him and he called to me and told me to tell Hugh where he was We made a good struggle though it failed Look here He pointed to his dress and to his bandaged head and still panting for breath glanced round the room then faced towards Hugh again I know you by sight he said for I was in the crowd on Friday and on Saturday and yesterday but I didn t know your name You re a bold fellow I know So is he He fought like a lion tonight but it was of no use I did my best considering that I want this limb Again he glanced inquisitively round the room or seemed to do so for his face was nearly hidden by the bandage and again facing sharply towards Hugh grasped his stick as if he half expected to be set upon and stood on the defensive If he had any such apprehension however he was speedily reassured by the demeanour of all present None thought of the bearer of the tidings He was lost in the news he brought Oaths threats and execrations were vented on all sides Some cried that if they bore this tamely another day would see them all in jail some that they should have rescued the other prisoners and this would not have happened One man cried in a loud voice Who ll follow me to Newgate and there was a loud shout and general rush towards the door But Hugh and Dennis stood with their backs against it and kept them back until the clamour had so far subsided that their voices could be heard when they called to them together that to go now in broad day would be madness and that if they waited until night and arranged a plan of attack they might release not only their own companions but all the prisoners and burn down the jail Not that jail alone cried Hugh but every jail in London They shall have no place to put their prisoners in We ll burn them all down make bonfires of them every one Here he cried catching at the hangman s hand Let all who re men here join with us Shake hands upon it Barnaby out of jail and not a jail left standing Who joins Every man there And they swore a great oath to release their friends from Newgate next night to force the doors and burn the jail or perish in the fire themselves Chapter 61 On that same night events so crowd upon each other in convulsed and distracted times that more than the stirring incidents of a whole life often become compressed into the compass of four and twenty hours on that same night Mr Haredale having strongly bound his prisoner with the assistance of the sexton and forced him to mount his horse conducted him to Chigwell bent upon procuring a conveyance to London from that place and carrying him at once before a justice The disturbed state of the town would be he knew a sufficient reason for demanding the murderer s committal to prison before daybreak as no man could answer for the security of any of the watch houses or ordinary places of detention and to convey a prisoner through the streets when the mob were again abroad would not only be a task of great danger and hazard but would be to challenge an attempt at rescue Directing the sexton to lead the horse he walked close by the murderer s side and in this order they reached the village about the middle of the night The people were all awake and up for they were fearful of being burnt in their beds and sought to comfort and assure each other by watching in company A few of the stoutest hearted were armed and gathered in a body on the green To these who knew him well Mr Haredale addressed himself briefly narrating what had happened and beseeching them to aid in conveying the criminal to London before the dawn of day But not a man among them dared to help him by so much as the motion of a finger The rioters in their passage through the village had menaced with their fiercest vengeance any person who should aid in extinguishing the fire or render the least assistance to him or any Catholic whomsoever Their threats extended to their lives and all they possessed They were assembled for their own protection and could not endanger themselves by lending any aid to him This they told him not without hesitation and regret as they kept aloof in the moonlight and glanced fearfully at the ghostly rider who with his head drooping on his breast and his hat slouched down upon his brow neither moved nor spoke Finding it impossible to persuade them and indeed hardly knowing how to do so after what they had seen of the fury of the crowd Mr Haredale besought them that at least they would leave him free to act for himself and would suffer him to take the only chaise and pair of horses that the place afforded This was not acceded to without some difficulty but in the end they told him to do what he would and go away from them in heaven s name Leaving the sexton at the horse s bridle he drew out the chaise with his own hands and would have harnessed the horses but that the post boy of the village a soft hearted good for nothing vagabond kind of fellow was moved by his earnestness and passion and throwing down a pitchfork with which he was armed swore that the rioters might cut him into mincemeat if they liked but he would not stand by and see an honest gentleman who had done no wrong reduced to such extremity without doing what he could to help him Mr Haredale shook him warmly by the hand and thanked him from his heart In five minutes time the chaise was ready and this good scapegrace in his saddle The murderer was put inside the blinds were drawn up the sexton took his seat upon the bar Mr Haredale mounted his horse and rode close beside the door and so they started in the dead of night and in profound silence for London The consternation was so extreme that even the horses which had escaped the flames at the Warren could find no friends to shelter them They passed them on the road browsing on the stunted grass and the driver told them that the poor beasts had wandered to the village first but had been driven away lest they should bring the vengeance of the crowd on any of the inhabitants Nor was this feeling confined to such small places where the people were timid ignorant and unprotected When they came near London they met in the grey light of morning more than one poor Catholic family who terrified by the threats and warnings of their neighbours were quitting the city on foot and who told them they could hire no cart or horse for the removal of their goods and had been compelled to leave them behind at the mercy of the crowd Near Mile End they passed a house the master of which a Catholic gentleman of small means having hired a waggon to remove his furniture by midnight had had it all brought down into the street to wait the vehicle s arrival and save time in the packing But the man with whom he made the bargain alarmed by the fires that night and by the sight of the rioters passing his door had refused to keep it and the poor gentleman with his wife and servant and their little children were sitting trembling among their goods in the open street dreading the arrival of day and not knowing where to turn or what to do It was the same they heard with the public conveyances The panic was so great that the mails and stage coaches were afraid to carry passengers who professed the obnoxious religion If the drivers knew them or they admitted that they held that creed they would not take them no though they offered large sums and yesterday people had been afraid to recognise Catholic acquaintance in the streets lest they should be marked by spies and burnt out as it was called in consequence One mild old man a priest whose chapel was destroyed a very feeble patient inoffensive creature who was trudging away alone designing to walk some distance from town and then try his fortune with the coaches told Mr Haredale that he feared he might not find a magistrate who would have the hardihood to commit a prisoner to jail on his complaint But notwithstanding these discouraging accounts they went on and reached the Mansion House soon after sunrise Mr Haredale threw himself from his horse but he had no need to knock at the door for it was already open and there stood upon the step a portly old man with a very red or rather purple face who with an anxious expression of countenance was remonstrating with some unseen personage upstairs while the porter essayed to close the door by degrees and get rid of him With the intense impatience and excitement natural to one in his condition Mr Haredale thrust himself forward and was about to speak when the fat old gentleman interposed My good sir said he pray let me get an answer This is the sixth time I have been here I was here five times yesterday My house is threatened with destruction It is to be burned down to night and was to have been last night but they had other business on their hands Pray let me get an answer My good sir returned Mr Haredale shaking his head my house is burned to the ground But heaven forbid that yours should be Get your answer Be brief in mercy to me Now you hear this my lord said the old gentleman calling up the stairs to where the skirt of a dressing gown fluttered on the landing place Here is a gentleman here whose house was actually burnt down last night Dear me dear me replied a testy voice I am very sorry for it but what am I to do I can t build it up again The chief magistrate of the city can t go and be a rebuilding of people s houses my good sir Stuff and nonsense But the chief magistrate of the city can prevent people s houses from having any need to be rebuilt if the chief magistrate s a man and not a dummy can t he my lord cried the old gentleman in a choleric manner You are disrespectable sir said the Lord Mayor leastways disrespectful I mean Disrespectful my lord returned the old gentleman I was respectful five times yesterday I can t be respectful for ever Men can t stand on being respectful when their houses are going to be burnt over their heads with them in em What am I to do my lord AM I to have any protection I told you yesterday sir said the Lord Mayor that you might have an alderman in your house if you could get one to come What the devil s the good of an alderman returned the choleric old gentleman To awe the crowd sir said the Lord Mayor Oh Lord ha mercy whimpered the old gentleman as he wiped his forehead in a state of ludicrous distress to think of sending an alderman to awe a crowd Why my lord if they were even so many babies fed on mother s milk what do you think they d care for an alderman Will YOU come I said the Lord Mayor most emphatically Certainly not Then what returned the old gentleman what am I to do Am I a citizen of England Am I to have the benefit of the laws Am I to have any return for the King s taxes I don t know I am sure said the Lord Mayor what a pity it is you re a Catholic Why couldn t you be a Protestant and then you wouldn t have got yourself into such a mess I m sure I don t know what s to be done There are great people at the bottom of these riots Oh dear me what a thing it is to be a public character You must look in again in the course of the day Would a javelin man do Or there s Philips the constable HE S disengaged he s not very old for a man at his time of life except in his legs and if you put him up at a window he d look quite young by candle light and might frighten em very much Oh dear well we ll see about it Stop cried Mr Haredale pressing the door open as the porter strove to shut it and speaking rapidly My Lord Mayor I beg you not to go away I have a man here who committed a murder eight and twenty years ago Half a dozen words from me on oath will justify you in committing him to prison for re examination I only seek just now to have him consigned to a place of safety The least delay may involve his being rescued by the rioters Oh dear me cried the Lord Mayor God bless my soul and body oh Lor well I there are great people at the bottom of these riots you know You really mustn t My lord said Mr Haredale the murdered gentleman was my brother I succeeded to his inheritance there were not wanting slanderous tongues at that time to whisper that the guilt of this most foul and cruel deed was mine mine who loved him as he knows in Heaven dearly The time has come after all these years of gloom and misery for avenging him and bringing to light a crime so artful and so devilish that it has no parallel Every second s delay on your part loosens this man s bloody hands again and leads to his escape My lord I charge you hear me and despatch this matter on the instant Oh dear me cried the chief magistrate these an t business hours you know I wonder at you how ungentlemanly it is of you you mustn t you really mustn t And I suppose you are a Catholic too I am said Mr Haredale God bless my soul I believe people turn Catholics a purpose to vex and worrit me cried the Lord Mayor I wish you wouldn t come here they ll be setting the Mansion House afire next and we shall have you to thank for it You must lock your prisoner up sir give him to a watchman and call again at a proper time Then we ll see about it Before Mr Haredale could answer the sharp closing of a door and drawing of its bolts gave notice that the Lord Mayor had retreated to his bedroom and that further remonstrance would be unavailing The two clients retreated likewise and the porter shut them out into the street That s the way he puts me off said the old gentleman I can get no redress and no help What are you going to do sir To try elsewhere answered Mr Haredale who was by this time on horseback I feel for you I assure you and well I may for we are in a common cause said the old gentleman I may not have a house to offer you to night let me tender it while I can On second thoughts though he added putting up a pocket book he had produced while speaking I ll not give you a card for if it was found upon you it might get you into trouble Langdale that s my name vintner and distiller Holborn Hill you re heartily welcome if you ll come Mr Haredale bowed and rode off close beside the chaise as before determining to repair to the house of Sir John Fielding who had the reputation of being a bold and active magistrate and fully resolved in case the rioters should come upon them to do execution on the murderer with his own hands rather than suffer him to be released They arrived at the magistrate s dwelling however without molestation for the mob as we have seen were then intent on deeper schemes and knocked at the door As it had been pretty generally rumoured that Sir John was proscribed by the rioters a body of thief takers had been keeping watch in the house all night To one of them Mr Haredale stated his business which appearing to the man of sufficient moment to warrant his arousing the justice procured him an immediate audience No time was lost in committing the murderer to Newgate then a new building recently completed at a vast expense and considered to be of enormous strength The warrant being made out three of the thief takers bound him afresh he had been struggling it seemed in the chaise and had loosened his manacles gagged him lest they should meet with any of the mob and he should call to them for help and seated themselves along with him in the carriage These men being all well armed made a formidable escort but they drew up the blinds again as though the carriage were empty and directed Mr Haredale to ride forward that he might not attract attention by seeming to belong to it The wisdom of this proceeding was sufficiently obvious for as they hurried through the city they passed among several groups of men who if they had not supposed the chaise to be quite empty would certainly have stopped it But those within keeping quite close and the driver tarrying to be asked no questions they reached the prison without interruption and once there had him out and safe within its gloomy walls in a twinkling With eager eyes and strained attention Mr Haredale saw him chained and locked and barred up in his cell Nay when he had left the jail and stood in the free street without he felt the iron plates upon the doors with his hands and drew them over the stone wall to assure himself that it was real and to exult in its being so strong and rough and cold It was not until he turned his back upon the jail and glanced along the empty streets so lifeless and quiet in the bright morning that he felt the weight upon his heart that he knew he was tortured by anxiety for those he had left at home and that home itself was but another bead in the long rosary of his regrets Chapter 62 The prisoner left to himself sat down upon his bedstead and resting his elbows on his knees and his chin upon his hands remained in that attitude for hours It would be hard to say of what nature his reflections were They had no distinctness and saving for some flashes now and then no reference to his condition or the train of circumstances by which it had been brought about The cracks in the pavement of his cell the chinks in the wall where stone was joined to stone the bars in the window the iron ring upon the floor such things as these subsiding strangely into one another and awakening an indescribable kind of interest and amusement engrossed his whole mind and although at the bottom of his every thought there was an uneasy sense of guilt and dread of death he felt no more than that vague consciousness of it which a sleeper has of pain It pursues him through his dreams gnaws at the heart of all his fancied pleasures robs the banquet of its taste music of its sweetness makes happiness itself unhappy and yet is no bodily sensation but a phantom without shape or form or visible presence pervading everything but having no existence recognisable everywhere but nowhere seen or touched or met with face to face until the sleep is past and waking agony returns After a long time the door of his cell opened He looked up saw the blind man enter and relapsed into his former position Guided by his breathing the visitor advanced to where he sat and stopping beside him and stretching out his hand to assure himself that he was right remained for a good space silent This is bad Rudge This is bad he said at length The prisoner shuffled with his feet upon the ground in turning his body from him but made no other answer How were you taken he asked And where You never told me more than half your secret No matter I know it now How was it and where eh he asked again coming still nearer to him At Chigwell said the other At Chigwell How came you there Because I went there to avoid the man I stumbled on he answered Because I was chased and driven there by him and Fate Because I was urged to go there by something stronger than my own will When I found him watching in the house she used to live in night after night I knew I never could escape him never and when I heard the Bell He shivered muttered that it was very cold paced quickly up and down the narrow cell and sitting down again fell into his old posture You were saying said the blind man after another pause that when you heard the Bell Let it be will you he retorted in a hurried voice It hangs there yet The blind man turned a wistful and inquisitive face towards him but he continued to speak without noticing him I went to Chigwell in search of the mob I have been so hunted and beset by this man that I knew my only hope of safety lay in joining them They had gone on before I followed them when it left off When what left off The Bell They had quitted the place I hoped that some of them might be still lingering among the ruins and was searching for them when I heard he drew a long breath and wiped his forehead with his sleeve his voice Saying what No matter what I don t know I was then at the foot of the turret where I did the Ay said the blind man nodding his head with perfect composure I understand I climbed the stair or so much of it as was left meaning to hide till he had gone But he heard me and followed almost as soon as I set foot upon the ashes You might have hidden in the wall and thrown him down or stabbed him said the blind man Might I Between that man and me was one who led him on I saw it though he did not and raised above his head a bloody hand It was in the room above that HE and I stood glaring at each other on the night of the murder and before he fell he raised his hand like that and fixed his eyes on me I knew the chase would end there You have a strong fancy said the blind man with a smile Strengthen yours with blood and see what it will come to He groaned and rocked himself and looking up for the first time said in a low hollow voice Eight and twenty years Eight and twenty years He has never changed in all that time never grown older nor altered in the least degree He has been before me in the dark night and the broad sunny day in the twilight the moonlight the sunlight the light of fire and lamp and candle and in the deepest gloom Always the same In company in solitude on land on shipboard sometimes leaving me alone for months and sometimes always with me I have seen him at sea come gliding in the dead of night along the bright reflection of the moon in the calm water and I have seen him on quays and market places with his hand uplifted towering the centre of a busy crowd unconscious of the terrible form that had its silent stand among them Fancy Are you real Am I Are these iron fetters riveted on me by the smith s hammer or are they fancies I can shatter at a blow The blind man listened in silence Fancy Do I fancy that I killed him Do I fancy that as I left the chamber where he lay I saw the face of a man peeping from a dark door who plainly showed me by his fearful looks that he suspected what I had done Do I remember that I spoke fairly to him that I drew nearer nearer yet with the hot knife in my sleeve Do I fancy how HE died Did he stagger back into the angle of the wall into which I had hemmed him and bleeding inwardly stand not fail a corpse before me Did I see him for an instant as I see you now erect and on his feet but dead The blind man who knew that he had risen motioned him to sit down again upon his bedstead but he took no notice of the gesture It was then I thought for the first time of fastening the murder upon him It was then I dressed him in my clothes and dragged him down the back stairs to the piece of water Do I remember listening to the bubbles that came rising up when I had rolled him in Do I remember wiping the water from my face and because the body splashed it there in its descent feeling as if it MUST be blood Did I go home when I had done And oh my God how long it took to do Did I stand before my wife and tell her Did I see her fall upon the ground and when I stooped to raise her did she thrust me back with a force that cast me off as if I had been a child staining the hand with which she clasped my wrist Is THAT fancy Did she go down upon her knees and call on Heaven to witness that she and her unborn child renounced me from that hour and did she in words so solemn that they turned me cold me fresh from the horrors my own hands had made warn me to fly while there was time for though she would be silent being my wretched wife she would not shelter me Did I go forth that night abjured of God and man and anchored deep in hell to wander at my cable s length about the earth and surely be drawn down at last Why did you return said the blind man Why is blood red I could no more help it than I could live without breath I struggled against the impulse but I was drawn back through every difficult and adverse circumstance as by a mighty engine Nothing could stop me The day and hour were none of my choice Sleeping and waking I had been among the old haunts for years had visited my own grave Why did I come back Because this jail was gaping for me and he stood beckoning at the door You were not known said the blind man I was a man who had been twenty two years dead No I was not known You should have kept your secret better MY secret MINE It was a secret any breath of air could whisper at its will The stars had it in their twinkling the water in its flowing the leaves in their rustling the seasons in their return It lurked in strangers faces and their voices Everything had lips on which it always trembled MY secret It was revealed by your own act at any rate said the blind man The act was not mine I did it but it was not mine I was forced at times to wander round and round and round that spot If you had chained me up when the fit was on me I should have broken away and gone there As truly as the loadstone draws iron towards it so he lying at the bottom of his grave could draw me near him when he would Was that fancy Did I like to go there or did I strive and wrestle with the power that forced me The blind man shrugged his shoulders and smiled incredulously The prisoner again resumed his old attitude and for a long time both were mute I suppose then said his visitor at length breaking silence that you are penitent and resigned that you desire to make peace with everybody in particular with your wife who has brought you to this and that you ask no greater favour than to be carried to Tyburn as soon as possible That being the case I had better take my leave I am not good enough to be company for you Have I not told you said the other fiercely that I have striven and wrestled with the power that brought me here Has my whole life for eight and twenty years been one perpetual struggle and resistance and do you think I want to lie down and die Do all men shrink from death I most of all That s better said That s better spoken Rudge but I ll not call you that again than anything you have said yet returned the blind man speaking more familiarly and laying his hands upon his arm Lookye I never killed a man myself for I have never been placed in a position that made it worth my while Farther I am not an advocate for killing men and I don t think I should recommend it or like it for it s very hazardous under any circumstances But as you had the misfortune to get into this trouble before I made your acquaintance and as you have been my companion and have been of use to me for a long time now I overlook that part of the matter and am only anxious that you shouldn t die unnecessarily Now I do not consider that at present it is at all necessary What else is left me returned the prisoner To eat my way through these walls with my teeth Something easier than that returned his friend Promise me that you will talk no more of these fancies of yours idle foolish things quite beneath a man and I ll tell you what I mean Tell me said the other Your worthy lady with the tender conscience your scrupulous virtuous punctilious but not blindly affectionate wife What of her Is now in London A curse upon her be she where she may That s natural enough If she had taken her annuity as usual you would not have been here and we should have been better off But that s apart from the business She s in London Scared as I suppose and have no doubt by my representation when I waited upon her that you were close at hand which I of course urged only as an inducement to compliance knowing that she was not pining to see you she left that place and travelled up to London How do you know From my friend the noble captain the illustrious general the bladder Mr Tappertit I learnt from him the last time I saw him which was yesterday that your son who is called Barnaby not after his father I suppose Death does that matter now You are impatient said the blind man calmly it s a good sign and looks like life that your son Barnaby had been lured away from her by one of his companions who knew him of old at Chigwell and that he is now among the rioters And what is that to me If father and son be hanged together what comfort shall I find in that Stay stay my friend returned the blind man with a cunning look you travel fast to journeys ends Suppose I track my lady out and say thus much You want your son ma am good I knowing those who tempt him to remain among them can restore him to you ma am good You must pay a price ma am for his restoration good again The price is small and easy to be paid dear ma am that s best of all What mockery is this Very likely she may reply in those words No mockery at all I answer Madam a person said to be your husband identity is difficult of proof after the lapse of many years is in prison his life in peril the charge against him murder Now ma am your husband has been dead a long long time The gentleman never can be confounded with him if you will have the goodness to say a few words on oath as to when he died and how and that this person who I am told resembles him in some degree is no more he than I am Such testimony will set the question quite at rest Pledge yourself to me to give it ma am and I will undertake to keep your son a fine lad out of harm s way until you have done this trifling service when he shall he delivered up to you safe and sound On the other hand if you decline to do so I fear he will be betrayed and handed over to the law which will assuredly sentence him to suffer death It is in fact a choice between his life and death If you refuse he swings If you comply the timber is not grown nor the hemp sown that shall do him any harm There is a gleam of hope in this cried the prisoner A gleam returned his friend a noon blaze a full and glorious daylight Hush I hear the tread of distant feet Rely on me When shall I hear more As soon as I do I should hope to morrow They are coming to say that our time for talk is over I hear the jingling of the keys Not another word of this just now or they may overhear us As he said these words the lock was turned and one of the prison turnkeys appearing at the door announced that it was time for visitors to leave the jail So soon said Stagg meekly But it can t be helped Cheer up friend This mistake will soon be set at rest and then you are a man again If this charitable gentleman will lead a blind man who has nothing in return but prayers to the prison porch and set him with his face towards the west he will do a worthy deed Thank you good sir I thank you very kindly So saying and pausing for an instant at the door to turn his grinning face towards his friend he departed When the officer had seen him to the porch he returned and again unlocking and unbarring the door of the cell set it wide open informing its inmate that he was at liberty to walk in the adjacent yard if he thought proper for an hour The prisoner answered with a sullen nod and being left alone again sat brooding over what he had heard and pondering upon the hopes the recent conversation had awakened gazing abstractedly the while he did so on the light without and watching the shadows thrown by one wall on another and on the stone paved ground It was a dull square yard made cold and gloomy by high walls and seeming to chill the very sunlight The stone so bare and rough and obdurate filled even him with longing thoughts of meadow land and trees and with a burning wish to be at liberty As he looked he rose and leaning against the door post gazed up at the bright blue sky smiling even on that dreary home of crime He seemed for a moment to remember lying on his back in some sweet scented place and gazing at it through moving branches long ago His attention was suddenly attracted by a clanking sound he knew what it was for he had startled himself by making the same noise in walking to the door Presently a voice began to sing and he saw the shadow of a figure on the pavement It stopped was silent all at once as though the person for a moment had forgotten where he was but soon remembered and so with the same clanking noise the shadow disappeared He walked out into the court and paced it to and fro startling the echoes as he went with the harsh jangling of his fetters There was a door near his which like his stood ajar He had not taken half a dozen turns up and down the yard when standing still to observe this door he heard the clanking sound again A face looked out of the grated window he saw it very dimly for the cell was dark and the bars were heavy and directly afterwards a man appeared and came towards him For the sense of loneliness he had he might have been in jail a year Made eager by the hope of companionship he quickened his pace and hastened to meet the man half way What was this His son They stood face to face staring at each other He shrinking and cowed despite himself Barnahy struggling with his imperfect memory and wondering where he had seen that face before He was not uncertain long for suddenly he laid hands upon him and striving to bear him to the ground cried Ah I know You are the robber He said nothing in reply at first but held down his head and struggled with him silently Finding the younger man too strong for him he raised his face looked close into his eyes and said I am your father God knows what magic the name had for his ears but Barnaby released his hold fell back and looked at him aghast Suddenly he sprung towards him put his arms about his neck and pressed his head against his cheek Yes yes he was he was sure he was But where had he been so long and why had he left his mother by herself or worse than by herself with her poor foolish boy And had she really been as happy as they said And where was she Was she near there She was not happy now and he in jail Ah no Not a word was said in answer but Grip croaked loudly and hopped about them round and round as if enclosing them in a magic circle and invoking all the powers of mischief Chapter 63 During the whole of this day every regiment in or near the metropolis was on duty in one or other part of the town and the regulars and militia in obedience to the orders which were sent to every barrack and station within twenty four hours journey began to pour in by all the roads But the disturbance had attained to such a formidable height and the rioters had grown with impunity to be so audacious that the sight of this great force continually augmented by new arrivals instead of operating as a check stimulated them to outrages of greater hardihood than any they had yet committed and helped to kindle a flame in London the like of which had never been beheld even in its ancient and rebellious times All yesterday and on this day likewise the commander in chief endeavoured to arouse the magistrates to a sense of their duty and in particular the Lord Mayor who was the faintest hearted and most timid of them all With this object large bodies of the soldiery were several times despatched to the Mansion House to await his orders but as he could by no threats or persuasions be induced to give any and as the men remained in the open street fruitlessly for any good purpose and thrivingly for a very bad one these laudable attempts did harm rather than good For the crowd becoming speedily acquainted with the Lord Mayor s temper did not fail to take advantage of it by boasting that even the civil authorities were opposed to the Papists and could not find it in their hearts to molest those who were guilty of no other offence These vaunts they took care to make within the hearing of the soldiers and they being naturally loth to quarrel with the people received their advances kindly enough answering when they were asked if they desired to fire upon their countrymen No they would be damned if they did and showing much honest simplicity and good nature The feeling that the military were No Popery men and were ripe for disobeying orders and joining the mob soon became very prevalent in consequence Rumours of their disaffection and of their leaning towards the popular cause spread from mouth to mouth with astonishing rapidity and whenever they were drawn up idly in the streets or squares there was sure to be a crowd about them cheering and shaking hands and treating them with a great show of confidence and affection By this time the crowd was everywhere all concealment and disguise were laid aside and they pervaded the whole town If any man among them wanted money he had but to knock at the door of a dwelling house or walk into a shop and demand it in the rioters name and his demand was instantly complied with The peaceable citizens being afraid to lay hands upon them singly and alone it may be easily supposed that when gathered together in bodies they were perfectly secure from interruption They assembled in the streets traversed them at their will and pleasure and publicly concerted their plans Business was quite suspended the greater part of the shops were closed most of the houses displayed a blue flag in token of their adherence to the popular side and even the Jews in Houndsditch Whitechapel and those quarters wrote upon their doors or window shutters This House is a True Protestant The crowd was the law and never was the law held in greater dread or more implicitly obeyed It was about six o clock in the evening when a vast mob poured into Lincoln s Inn Fields by every avenue and divided evidently in pursuance of a previous design into several parties It must not be understood that this arrangement was known to the whole crowd but that it was the work of a few leaders who mingling with the men as they came upon the ground and calling to them to fall into this or that parry effected it as rapidly as if it had been determined on by a council of the whole number and every man had known his place It was perfectly notorious to the assemblage that the largest body which comprehended about two thirds of the whole was designed for the attack on Newgate It comprehended all the rioters who had been conspicuous in any of their former proceedings all those whom they recommended as daring hands and fit for the work all those whose companions had been taken in the riots and a great number of people who were relatives or friends of felons in the jail This last class included not only the most desperate and utterly abandoned villains in London but some who were comparatively innocent There was more than one woman there disguised in man s attire and bent upon the rescue of a child or brother There were the two sons of a man who lay under sentence of death and who was to be executed along with three others on the next day but one There was a great parry of boys whose fellow pickpockets were in the prison and at the skirts of all a score of miserable women outcasts from the world seeking to release some other fallen creature as miserable as themselves or moved by a general sympathy perhaps God knows with all who were without hope and wretched Old swords and pistols without ball or powder sledge hammers knives axes saws and weapons pillaged from the butchers shops a forest of iron bars and wooden clubs long ladders for scaling the walls each carried on the shoulders of a dozen men lighted torches tow smeared with pitch and tar and brimstone staves roughly plucked from fence and paling and even crutches taken from crippled beggars in the streets composed their arms When all was ready Hugh and Dennis with Simon Tappertit between them led the way Roaring and chafing like an angry sea the crowd pressed after them Instead of going straight down Holborn to the jail as all expected their leaders took the way to Clerkenwell and pouring down a quiet street halted before a locksmith s house the Golden Key Beat at the door cried Hugh to the men about him We want one of his craft to night Beat it in if no one answers The shop was shut Both door and shutters were of a strong and sturdy kind and they knocked without effect But the impatient crowd raising a cry of Set fire to the house and torches being passed to the front an upper window was thrown open and the stout old locksmith stood before them What now you villains he demanded Where is my daughter Ask no questions of us old man retorted Hugh waving his comrades to be silent but come down and bring the tools of your trade We want you Want me cried the locksmith glancing at the regimental dress he wore Ay and if some that I could name possessed the hearts of mice ye should have had me long ago Mark me my lad and you about him do the same There are a score among ye whom I see now and know who are dead men from this hour Begone and rob an undertaker s while you can You ll want some coffins before long Will you come down cried Hugh Will you give me my daughter ruffian cried the locksmith I know nothing of her Hugh rejoined Burn the door Stop cried the locksmith in a voice that made them falter presenting as he spoke a gun Let an old man do that You can spare him better The young fellow who held the light and who was stooping down before the door rose hastily at these words and fell back The locksmith ran his eye along the upturned faces and kept the weapon levelled at the threshold of his house It had no other rest than his shoulder but was as steady as the house itself Let the man who does it take heed to his prayers he said firmly I warn him Snatching a torch from one who stood near him Hugh was stepping forward with an oath when he was arrested by a shrill and piercing shriek and looking upward saw a fluttering garment on the house top There was another shriek and another and then a shrill voice cried Is Simmun below At the same moment a lean neck was stretched over the parapet and Miss Miggs indistinctly seen in the gathering gloom of evening screeched in a frenzied manner Oh dear gentlemen let me hear Simmuns s answer from his own lips Speak to me Simmun Speak to me Mr Tappertit who was not at all flattered by this compliment looked up and bidding her hold her peace ordered her to come down and open the door for they wanted her master and would take no denial Oh good gentlemen cried Miss Miggs Oh my own precious precious Simmun Hold your nonsense will you retorted Mr Tappertit and come down and open the door G Varden drop that gun or it will be worse for you Don t mind his gun screamed Miggs Simmun and gentlemen I poured a mug of table beer right down the barrel The crowd gave a loud shout which was followed by a roar of laughter It wouldn t go off not if you was to load it up to the muzzle screamed Miggs Simmun and gentlemen I m locked up in the front attic through the little door on the right hand when you think you ve got to the very top of the stairs and up the flight of corner steps being careful not to knock your heads against the rafters and not to tread on one side in case you should fall into the two pair bedroom through the lath and plasture which do not bear but the contrairy Simmun and gentlemen I ve been locked up here for safety but my endeavours has always been and always will be to be on the right side the blessed side and to prenounce the Pope of Babylon and all her inward and her outward workings which is Pagin My sentiments is of little consequences I know cried Miggs with additional shrillness for my positions is but a servant and as sich of humilities still I gives expressions to my feelings and places my reliances on them which entertains my own opinions Without taking much notice of these outpourings of Miss Miggs after she had made her first announcement in relation to the gun the crowd raised a ladder against the window where the locksmith stood and notwithstanding that he closed and fastened and defended it manfully soon forced an entrance by shivering the glass and breaking in the frames After dealing a few stout blows about him he found himself defenceless in the midst of a furious crowd which overflowed the room and softened off in a confused heap of faces at the door and window They were very wrathful with him for he had wounded two men and even called out to those in front to bring him forth and hang him on a lamp post But Gabriel was quite undaunted and looked from Hugh and Dennis who held him by either arm to Simon Tappertit who confronted him You have robbed me of my daughter said the locksmith who is far dearer to me than my life and you may take my life if you will I bless God that I have been enabled to keep my wife free of this scene and that He has made me a man who will not ask mercy at such hands as yours And a wery game old gentleman you are said Mr Dennis approvingly and you express yourself like a man What s the odds brother whether it s a lamp post to night or a feather bed ten year to come eh The locksmith glanced at him disdainfully but returned no other answer For my part said the hangman who particularly favoured the lamp post suggestion I honour your principles They re mine exactly In such sentiments as them and here he emphasised his discourse with an oath I m ready to meet you or any man halfway Have you got a bit of cord anywheres handy Don t put yourself out of the way if you haven t A handkecher will do Don t be a fool master whispered Hugh seizing Varden roughly by the shoulder but do as you re bid You ll soon hear what you re wanted for Do it I ll do nothing at your request or that of any scoundrel here returned the locksmith If you want any service from me you may spare yourselves the pains of telling me what it is I tell you beforehand I ll do nothing for you Mr Dennis was so affected by this constancy on the part of the staunch old man that he protested almost with tears in his eyes that to baulk his inclinations would be an act of cruelty and hard dealing to which he for one never could reconcile his conscience The gentleman he said had avowed in so many words that he was ready for working off such being the case he considered it their duty as a civilised and enlightened crowd to work him off It was not often he observed that they had it in their power to accommodate themselves to the wishes of those from whom they had the misfortune to differ Having now found an individual who expressed a desire which they could reasonably indulge and for himself he was free to confess that in his opinion that desire did honour to his feelings he hoped they would decide to accede to his proposition before going any further It was an experiment which skilfully and dexterously performed would be over in five minutes with great comfort and satisfaction to all parties and though it did not become him Mr Dennis to speak well of himself he trusted he might be allowed to say that he had practical knowledge of the subject and being naturally of an obliging and friendly disposition would work the gentleman off with a deal of pleasure These remarks which were addressed in the midst of a frightful din and turmoil to those immediately about him were received with great favour not so much perhaps because of the hangman s eloquence as on account of the locksmith s obstinacy Gabriel was in imminent peril and he knew it but he preserved a steady silence and would have done so if they had been debating whether they should roast him at a slow fire As the hangman spoke there was some stir and confusion on the ladder and directly he was silent so immediately upon his holding his peace that the crowd below had no time to learn what he had been saying or to shout in response some one at the window cried He has a grey head He is an old man Don t hurt him The locksmith turned with a start towards the place from which the words had come and looked hurriedly at the people who were hanging on the ladder and clinging to each other Pay no respect to my grey hair young man he said answering the voice and not any one he saw I don t ask it My heart is green enough to scorn and despise every man among you band of robbers that you are This incautious speech by no means tended to appease the ferocity of the crowd They cried again to have him brought out and it would have gone hard with the honest locksmith but that Hugh reminded them in answer that they wanted his services and must have them So tell him what we want he said to Simon Tappertit and quickly And open your ears master if you would ever use them after to night Gabriel folded his arms which were now at liberty and eyed his old prentice in silence Lookye Varden said Sim we re bound for Newgate I know you are returned the locksmith You never said a truer word than that To burn it down I mean said Simon and force the gates and set the prisoners at liberty You helped to make the lock of the great door I did said the locksmith You owe me no thanks for that as you ll find before long Maybe returned his journeyman but you must show us how to force it Must I Yes for you know and I don t You must come along with us and pick it with your own hands When I do said the locksmith quietly my hands shall drop off at the wrists and you shall wear them Simon Tappertit on your shoulders for epaulettes We ll see that cried Hugh interposing as the indignation of the crowd again burst forth You fill a basket with the tools he ll want while I bring him downstairs Open the doors below some of you And light the great captain others Is there no business afoot my lads that you can do nothing but stand and grumble They looked at one another and quickly dispersing swarmed over the house plundering and breaking according to their custom and carrying off such articles of value as happened to please their fancy They had no great length of time for these proceedings for the basket of tools was soon prepared and slung over a man s shoulders The preparations being now completed and everything ready for the attack those who were pillaging and destroying in the other rooms were called down to the workshop They were about to issue forth when the man who had been last upstairs stepped forward and asked if the young woman in the garret who was making a terrible noise he said and kept on screaming without the least cessation was to be released For his own part Simon Tappertit would certainly have replied in the negative but the mass of his companions mindful of the good service she had done in the matter of the gun being of a different opinion he had nothing for it but to answer Yes The man accordingly went back again to the rescue and presently returned with Miss Miggs limp and doubled up and very damp from much weeping As the young lady had given no tokens of consciousness on their way downstairs the bearer reported her either dead or dying and being at some loss what to do with her was looking round for a convenient bench or heap of ashes on which to place her senseless form when she suddenly came upon her feet by some mysterious means thrust back her hair stared wildly at Mr Tappertit cried My Simmuns s life is not a wictim and dropped into his arms with such promptitude that he staggered and reeled some paces back beneath his lovely burden Oh bother said Mr Tappertit Here Catch hold of her somebody Lock her up again she never ought to have been let out My Simmun cried Miss Miggs in tears and faintly My for ever ever blessed Simmun Hold up will you said Mr Tappertit in a very unresponsive tone I ll let you fall if you don t What are you sliding your feet off the ground for My angel Simmuns murmured Miggs he promised Promised Well and I ll keep my promise answered Simon testily I mean to provide for you don t I Stand up Where am I to go What is to become of me after my actions of this night cried Miggs What resting places now remains but in the silent tombses I wish you was in the silent tombses I do cried Mr Tappertit and boxed up tight in a good strong one Here he cried to one of the bystanders in whose ear he whispered for a moment Take her off will you You understand where The fellow nodded and taking her in his arms notwithstanding her broken protestations and her struggles which latter species of opposition involving scratches was much more difficult of resistance carried her away They who were in the house poured out into the street the locksmith was taken to the head of the crowd and required to walk between his two conductors the whole body was put in rapid motion and without any shouts or noise they bore down straight on Newgate and halted in a dense mass before the prison gate Chapter 64 Breaking the silence they had hitherto preserved they raised a great cry as soon as they were ranged before the jail and demanded to speak to the governor This visit was not wholly unexpected for his house which fronted the street was strongly barricaded the wicket gate of the prison was closed up and at no loophole or grating was any person to be seen Before they had repeated their summons many times a man appeared upon the roof of the governor s house and asked what it was they wanted Some said one thing some another and some only groaned and hissed It being now nearly dark and the house high many persons in the throng were not aware that any one had come to answer them and continued their clamour until the intelligence was gradually diffused through the whole concourse Ten minutes or more elapsed before any one voice could be heard with tolerable distinctness during which interval the figure remained perched alone against the summer evening sky looking down into the troubled street Are you said Hugh at length Mr Akerman the head jailer here Of course he is brother whispered Dennis But Hugh without minding him took his answer from the man himself Yes he said I am You have got some friends of ours in your custody master I have a good many people in my custody He glanced downward as he spoke into the jail and the feeling that he could see into the different yards and that he overlooked everything which was hidden from their view by the rugged walls so lashed and goaded the mob that they howled like wolves Deliver up our friends said Hugh and you may keep the rest It s my duty to keep them all I shall do my duty If you don t throw the doors open we shall break em down said Hugh for we will have the rioters out All I can do good people Akerman replied is to exhort you to disperse and to remind you that the consequences of any disturbance in this place will be very severe and bitterly repented by most of you when it is too late He made as though he would retire when he said these words but he was checked by the voice of the locksmith Mr Akerman cried Gabriel Mr Akerman I will hear no more from any of you replied the governor turning towards the speaker and waving his hand But I am not one of them said Gabriel I am an honest man Mr Akerman a respectable tradesman Gabriel Varden the locksmith You know me You among the crowd cried the governor in an altered voice Brought here by force brought here to pick the lock of the great door for them rejoined the locksmith Bear witness for me Mr Akerman that I refuse to do it and that I will not do it come what may of my refusal If any violence is done to me please to remember this Is there no way if helping you said the governor None Mr Akerman You ll do your duty and I ll do mine Once again you robbers and cut throats said the locksmith turning round upon them I refuse Ah Howl till you re hoarse I refuse Stay stay said the jailer hastily Mr Varden I know you for a worthy man and one who would do no unlawful act except upon compulsion Upon compulsion sir interposed the locksmith who felt that the tone in which this was said conveyed the speaker s impression that he had ample excuse for yielding to the furious multitude who beset and hemmed him in on every side and among whom he stood an old man quite alone upon compulsion sir I ll do nothing Where is that man said the keeper anxiously who spoke to me just now Here Hugh replied Do you know what the guilt of murder is and that by keeping that honest tradesman at your side you endanger his life We know it very well he answered for what else did we bring him here Let s have our friends master and you shall have your friend Is that fair lads The mob replied to him with a loud Hurrah You see how it is sir cried Varden Keep em out in King George s name Remember what I have said Good night There was no more parley A shower of stones and other missiles compelled the keeper of the jail to retire and the mob pressing on and swarming round the walls forced Gabriel Varden close up to the door In vain the basket of tools was laid upon the ground before him and he was urged in turn by promises by blows by offers of reward and threats of instant death to do the office for which they had brought him there No cried the sturdy locksmith I will not He had never loved his life so well as then but nothing could move him The savage faces that glared upon him look where he would the cries of those who thirsted like wild animals for his blood the sight of men pressing forward and trampling down their fellows as they strove to reach him and struck at him above the heads of other men with axes and with iron bars all failed to daunt him He looked from man to man and face to face and still with quickened breath and lessening colour cried firmly I will not Dennis dealt him a blow upon the face which felled him to the ground He sprung up again like a man in the prime of life and with blood upon his forehead caught him by the throat You cowardly dog he said Give me my daughter Give me my daughter They struggled together Some cried Kill him and some but they were not near enough strove to trample him to death Tug as he would at the old man s wrists the hangman could not force him to unclench his hands Is this all the return you make me you ungrateful monster he articulated with great difficulty and with many oaths Give me my daughter cried the locksmith who was now as fierce as those who gathered round him Give me my daughter He was down again and up and down once more and buffeting with a score of them who bandied him from hand to hand when one tall fellow fresh from a slaughter house whose dress and great thigh boots smoked hot with grease and blood raised a pole axe and swearing a horrible oath aimed it at the old man s uncovered head At that instant and in the very act he fell himself as if struck by lightning and over his body a one armed man came darting to the locksmith s side Another man was with him and both caught the locksmith roughly in their grasp Leave him to us they cried to Hugh struggling as they spoke to force a passage backward through the crowd Leave him to us Why do you waste your whole strength on such as he when a couple of men can finish him in as many minutes You lose time Remember the prisoners remember Barnaby The cry ran through the mob Hammers began to rattle on the walls and every man strove to reach the prison and be among the foremost rank Fighting their way through the press and struggle as desperately as if they were in the midst of enemies rather than their own friends the two men retreated with the locksmith between them and dragged him through the very heart of the concourse And now the strokes began to fall like hail upon the gate and on the strong building for those who could not reach the door spent their fierce rage on anything even on the great blocks of stone which shivered their weapons into fragments and made their hands and arms to tingle as if the walls were active in their stout resistance and dealt them back their blows The clash of iron ringing upon iron mingled with the deafening tumult and sounded high above it as the great sledge hammers rattled on the nailed and plated door the sparks flew off in showers men worked in gangs and at short intervals relieved each other that all their strength might be devoted to the work but there stood the portal still as grim and dark and strong as ever and saving for the dints upon its battered surface quite unchanged While some brought all their energies to bear upon this toilsome task and some rearing ladders against the prison tried to clamber to the summit of the walls they were too short to scale and some again engaged a body of police a hundred strong and beat them back and trod them under foot by force of numbers others besieged the house on which the jailer had appeared and driving in the door brought out his furniture and piled it up against the prison gate to make a bonfire which should burn it down As soon as this device was understood all those who had laboured hitherto cast down their tools and helped to swell the heap which reached half way across the street and was so high that those who threw more fuel on the top got up by ladders When all the keeper s goods were flung upon this costly pile to the last fragment they smeared it with the pitch and tar and rosin they had brought and sprinkled it with turpentine To all the woodwork round the prison doors they did the like leaving not a joist or beam untouched This infernal christening performed they fired the pile with lighted matches and with blazing tow and then stood by awaiting the result The furniture being very dry and rendered more combustible by wax and oil besides the arts they had used took fire at once The flames roared high and fiercely blackening the prison wall and twining up its loftly front like burning serpents At first they crowded round the blaze and vented their exultation only in their looks but when it grew hotter and fiercer when it crackled leaped and roared like a great furnace when it shone upon the opposite houses and lighted up not only the pale and wondering faces at the windows but the inmost corners of each habitation when through the deep red heat and glow the fire was seen sporting and toying with the door now clinging to its obdurate surface now gliding off with fierce inconstancy and soaring high into the sky anon returning to fold it in its burning grasp and lure it to its ruin when it shone and gleamed so brightly that the church clock of St Sepulchre s so often pointing to the hour of death was legible as in broad day and the vane upon its steeple top glittered in the unwonted light like something richly jewelled when blackened stone and sombre brick grew ruddy in the deep reflection and windows shone like burnished gold dotting the longest distance in the fiery vista with their specks of brightness when wall and tower and roof and chimney stack seemed drunk and in the flickering glare appeared to reel and stagger when scores of objects never seen before burst out upon the view and things the most familiar put on some new aspect then the mob began to join the whirl and with loud yells and shouts and clamour such as happily is seldom heard bestirred themselves to feed the fire and keep it at its height Although the heat was so intense that the paint on the houses over against the prison parched and crackled up and swelling into boils as it were from excess of torture broke and crumbled away although the glass fell from the window sashes and the lead and iron on the roofs blistered the incautious hand that touched them and the sparrows in the eaves took wing and rendered giddy by the smoke fell fluttering down upon the blazing pile still the fire was tended unceasingly by busy hands and round it men were going always They never slackened in their zeal or kept aloof but pressed upon the flames so hard that those in front had much ado to save themselves from being thrust in if one man swooned or dropped a dozen struggled for his place and that although they knew the pain and thirst and pressure to be unendurable Those who fell down in fainting fits and were not crushed or burnt were carried to an inn yard close at hand and dashed with water from a pump of which buckets full were passed from man to man among the crowd but such was the strong desire of all to drink and such the fighting to be first that for the most part the whole contents were spilled upon the ground without the lips of one man being moistened Meanwhile and in the midst of all the roar and outcry those who were nearest to the pile heaped up again the burning fragments that came toppling down and raked the fire about the door which although a sheet of flame was still a door fast locked and barred and kept them out Great pieces of blazing wood were passed besides above the people s heads to such as stood about the ladders and some of these climbing up to the topmost stave and holding on with one hand by the prison wall exerted all their skill and force to cast these fire brands on the roof or down into the yards within In many instances their efforts were successful which occasioned a new and appalling addition to the horrors of the scene for the prisoners within seeing from between their bars that the fire caught in many places and thrived fiercely and being all locked up in strong cells for the night began to know that they were in danger of being burnt alive This terrible fear spreading from cell to cell and from yard to yard vented itself in such dismal cries and wailings and in such dreadful shrieks for help that the whole jail resounded with the noise which was loudly heard even above the shouting of the mob and roaring of the flames and was so full of agony and despair that it made the boldest tremble It was remarkable that these cries began in that quarter of the jail which fronted Newgate Street where it was well known the men who were to suffer death on Thursday were confined And not only were these four who had so short a time to live the first to whom the dread of being burnt occurred but they were throughout the most importunate of all for they could be plainly heard notwithstanding the great thickness of the walls crying that the wind set that way and that the flames would shortly reach them and calling to the officers of the jail to come and quench the fire from a cistern which was in their yard and full of water Judging from what the crowd outside the walls could hear from time to time these four doomed wretches never ceased to call for help and that with as much distraction and in as great a frenzy of attachment to existence as though each had an honoured happy life before him instead of eight and forty hours of miserable imprisonment and then a violent and shameful death But the anguish and suffering of the two sons of one of these men when they heard or fancied that they heard their father s voice is past description After wringing their hands and rushing to and fro as if they were stark mad one mounted on the shoulders of his brother and tried to clamber up the face of the high wall guarded at the top with spikes and points of iron And when he fell among the crowd he was not deterred by his bruises but mounted up again and fell again and when he found the feat impossible began to beat the stones and tear them with his hands as if he could that way make a breach in the strong building and force a passage in At last they cleft their way among the mob about the door though many men a dozen times their match had tried in vain to do so and were seen in yes in the fire striving to prize it down with crowbars Nor were they alone affected by the outcry from within the prison The women who were looking on shrieked loudly beat their hands together stopped their ears and many fainted the men who were not near the walls and active in the siege rather than do nothing tore up the pavement of the street and did so with a haste and fury they could not have surpassed if that had been the jail and they were near their object Not one living creature in the throng was for an instant still The whole great mass were mad A shout Another Another yet though few knew why or what it meant But those around the gate had seen it slowly yield and drop from its topmost hinge It hung on that side by but one but it was upright still because of the bar and its having sunk of its own weight into the heap of ashes at its foot There was now a gap at the top of the doorway through which could be descried a gloomy passage cavernous and dark Pile up the fire It burnt fiercely The door was red hot and the gap wider They vainly tried to shield their faces with their hands and standing as if in readiness for a spring watched the place Dark figures some crawling on their hands and knees some carried in the arms of others were seen to pass along the roof It was plain the jail could hold out no longer The keeper and his officers and their wives and children were escaping Pile up the fire The door sank down again it settled deeper in the cinders tottered yielded was down As they shouted again they fell back for a moment and left a clear space about the fire that lay between them and the jail entry Hugh leapt upon the blazing heap and scattering a train of sparks into the air and making the dark lobby glitter with those that hung upon his dress dashed into the jail The hangman followed And then so many rushed upon their track that the fire got trodden down and thinly strewn about the street but there was no need of it now for inside and out the prison was in flames Chapter 65 During the whole course of the terrible scene which was now at its height one man in the jail suffered a degree of fear and mental torment which had no parallel in the endurance even of those who lay under sentence of death When the rioters first assembled before the building the murderer was roused from sleep if such slumbers as his may have that blessed name by the roar of voices and the struggling of a great crowd He started up as these sounds met his ear and sitting on his bedstead listened After a short interval of silence the noise burst out again Still listening attentively he made out in course of time that the jail was besieged by a furious multitude His guilty conscience instantly arrayed these men against himself and brought the fear upon him that he would be singled out and torn to pieces Once impressed with the terror of this conceit everything tended to confirm and strengthen it His double crime the circumstances under which it had been committed the length of time that had elapsed and its discovery in spite of all made him as it were the visible object of the Almighty s wrath In all the crime and vice and moral gloom of the great pest house of the capital he stood alone marked and singled out by his great guilt a Lucifer among the devils The other prisoners were a host hiding and sheltering each other a crowd like that without the walls He was one man against the whole united concourse a single solitary lonely man from whom the very captives in the jail fell off and shrunk appalled It might be that the intelligence of his capture having been bruited abroad they had come there purposely to drag him out and kill him in the street or it might be that they were the rioters and in pursuance of an old design had come to sack the prison But in either case he had no belief or hope that they would spare him Every shout they raised and every sound they made was a blow upon his heart As the attack went on he grew more wild and frantic in his terror tried to pull away the bars that guarded the chimney and prevented him from climbing up called loudly on the turnkeys to cluster round the cell and save him from the fury of the rabble or put him in some dungeon underground no matter of what depth how dark it was or loathsome or beset with rats and creeping things so that it hid him and was hard to find But no one came or answered him Fearful even while he cried to them of attracting attention he was silent By and bye he saw as he looked from his grated window a strange glimmering on the stone walls and pavement of the yard It was feeble at first and came and went as though some officers with torches were passing to and fro upon the roof of the prison Soon it reddened and lighted brands came whirling down spattering the ground with fire and burning sullenly in corners One rolled beneath a wooden bench and set it in a blaze another caught a water spout and so went climbing up the wall leaving a long straight track of fire behind it After a time a slow thick shower of burning fragments from some upper portion of the prison which was blazing nigh began to fall before his door Remembering that it opened outwards he knew that every spark which fell upon the heap and in the act lost its bright life and died an ugly speck of dust and rubbish helped to entomb him in a living grave Still though the jail resounded with shrieks and cries for help though the fire bounded up as if each separate flame had had a tiger s life and roared as though in every one there were a hungry voice though the heat began to grow intense and the air suffocating and the clamour without increased and the danger of his situation even from one merciless element was every moment more extreme still he was afraid to raise his voice again lest the crowd should break in and should of their own ears or from the information given them by the other prisoners get the clue to his place of confinement Thus fearful alike of those within the prison and of those without of noise and silence light and darkness of being released and being left there to die he was so tortured and tormented that nothing man has ever done to man in the horrible caprice of power and cruelty exceeds his self inflicted punishment Now now the door was down Now they came rushing through the jail calling to each other in the vaulted passages clashing the iron gates dividing yard from yard beating at the doors of cells and wards wrenching off bolts and locks and bars tearing down the door posts to get men out endeavouring to drag them by main force through gaps and windows where a child could scarcely pass whooping and yelling without a moment s rest and running through the heat and flames as if they were cased in metal By their legs their arms the hair upon their heads they dragged the prisoners out Some threw themselves upon the captives as they got towards the door and tried to file away their irons some danced about them with a frenzied joy and rent their clothes and were ready as it seemed to tear them limb from limb Now a party of a dozen men came darting through the yard into which the murderer cast fearful glances from his darkened window dragging a prisoner along the ground whose dress they had nearly torn from his body in their mad eagerness to set him free and who was bleeding and senseless in their hands Now a score of prisoners ran to and fro who had lost themselves in the intricacies of the prison and were so bewildered with the noise and glare that they knew not where to turn or what to do and still cried out for help as loudly as before Anon some famished wretch whose theft had been a loaf of bread or scrap of butcher s meat came skulking past barefooted going slowly away because that jail his house was burning not because he had any other or had friends to meet or old haunts to revisit or any liberty to gain but liberty to starve and die And then a knot of highwaymen went trooping by conducted by the friends they had among the crowd who muffled their fetters as they went along with handkerchiefs and bands of hay and wrapped them in coats and cloaks and gave them drink from bottles and held it to their lips because of their handcuffs which there was no time to remove All this and Heaven knows how much more was done amidst a noise a hurry and distraction like nothing that we know of even in our dreams which seemed for ever on the rise and never to decrease for the space of a single instant He was still looking down from his window upon these things when a band of men with torches ladders axes and many kinds of weapons poured into the yard and hammering at his door inquired if there were any prisoner within He left the window when he saw them coming and drew back into the remotest corner of the cell but although he returned them no answer they had a fancy that some one was inside for they presently set ladders against it and began to tear away the bars at the casement not only that indeed but with pickaxes to hew down the very stones in the wall As soon as they had made a breach at the window large enough for the admission of a man s head one of them thrust in a torch and looked all round the room He followed this man s gaze until it rested on himself and heard him demand why he had not answered but made him no reply In the general surprise and wonder they were used to this without saying anything more they enlarged the breach until it was large enough to admit the body of a man and then came dropping down upon the floor one after another until the cell was full They caught him up among them handed him to the window and those who stood upon the ladders passed him down upon the pavement of the yard Then the rest came out one after another and bidding him fly and lose no time or the way would be choked up hurried away to rescue others It seemed not a minute s work from first to last He staggered to his feet incredulous of what had happened when the yard was filled again and a crowd rushed on hurrying Barnaby among them In another minute not so much another minute the same instant with no lapse or interval between he and his son were being passed from hand to hand through the dense crowd in the street and were glancing backward at a burning pile which some one said was Newgate From the moment of their first entrance into the prison the crowd dispersed themselves about it and swarmed into every chink and crevice as if they had a perfect acquaintance with its innermost parts and bore in their minds an exact plan of the whole For this immediate knowledge of the place they were no doubt in a great degree indebted to the hangman who stood in the lobby directing some to go this way some that and some the other and who materially assisted in bringing about the wonderful rapidity with which the release of the prisoners was effected But this functionary of the law reserved one important piece of intelligence and kept it snugly to himself When he had issued his instructions relative to every other part of the building and the mob were dispersed from end to end and busy at their work he took a bundle of keys from a kind of cupboard in the wall and going by a kind of passage near the chapel it joined the governors house and was then on fire betook himself to the condemned cells which were a series of small strong dismal rooms opening on a low gallery guarded at the end at which he entered by a strong iron wicket and at its opposite extremity by two doors and a thick grate Having double locked the wicket and assured himself that the other entrances were well secured he sat down on a bench in the gallery and sucked the head of his stick with the utmost complacency tranquillity and contentment It would have been strange enough a man s enjoying himself in this quiet manner while the prison was burning and such a tumult was cleaving the air though he had been outside the walls But here in the very heart of the building and moreover with the prayers and cries of the four men under sentence sounding in his ears and their hands stretched our through the gratings in their cell doors clasped in frantic entreaty before his very eyes it was particularly remarkable Indeed Mr Dennis appeared to think it an uncommon circumstance and to banter himself upon it for he thrust his hat on one side as some men do when they are in a waggish humour sucked the head of his stick with a higher relish and smiled as though he would say Dennis you re a rum dog you re a queer fellow you re capital company Dennis and quite a character He sat in this way for some minutes while the four men in the cells who were certain that somebody had entered the gallery but could not see who gave vent to such piteous entreaties as wretches in their miserable condition may be supposed to have been inspired with urging whoever it was to set them at liberty for the love of Heaven and protesting with great fervour and truly enough perhaps for the time that if they escaped they would amend their ways and would never never never again do wrong before God or man but would lead penitent and sober lives and sorrowfully repent the crimes they had committed The terrible energy with which they spoke would have moved any person no matter how good or just if any good or just person could have strayed into that sad place that night to have set them at liberty and while he would have left any other punishment to its free course to have saved them from this last dreadful and repulsive penalty which never turned a man inclined to evil and has hardened thousands who were half inclined to good Mr Dennis who had been bred and nurtured in the good old school and had administered the good old laws on the good old plan always once and sometimes twice every six weeks for a long time bore these appeals with a deal of philosophy Being at last however rather disturbed in his pleasant reflection by their repetition he rapped at one of the doors with his stick and cried Hold your noise there will you At this they all cried together that they were to be hanged on the next day but one and again implored his aid Aid For what said Mr Dennis playfully rapping the knuckles of the hand nearest him To save us they cried Oh certainly said Mr Dennis winking at the wall in the absence of any friend with whom he could humour the joke And so you re to be worked off are you brothers Unless we are released to night one of them cried we are dead men I tell you what it is said the hangman gravely I m afraid my friend that you re not in that ere state of mind that s suitable to your condition then you re not a going to be released don t think it Will you leave off that ere indecent row I wonder you an t ashamed of yourselves I do He followed up this reproof by rapping every set of knuckles one after the other and having done so resumed his seat again with a cheerful countenance You ve had law he said crossing his legs and elevating his eyebrows laws have been made a purpose for you a wery handsome prison s been made a purpose for you a parson s kept a purpose for you a constitootional officer s appointed a purpose for you carts is maintained a purpose for you and yet you re not contented WILL you hold that noise you sir in the furthest A groan was the only answer So well as I can make out said Mr Dennis in a tone of mingled badinage and remonstrance there s not a man among you I begin to think I m on the opposite side and among the ladies though for the matter of that I ve seen a many ladies face it out in a manner that did honour to the sex You in number two don t grind them teeth of yours Worse manners said the hangman rapping at the door with his stick I never see in this place afore I m ashamed of you You re a disgrace to the Bailey After pausing for a moment to hear if anything could be pleaded in justification Mr Dennis resumed in a sort of coaxing tone Now look ee here you four I m come here to take care of you and see that you an t burnt instead of the other thing It s no use your making any noise for you won t be found out by them as has broken in and you ll only be hoarse when you come to the speeches which is a pity What I say in respect to the speeches always is Give it mouth That s my maxim Give it mouth I ve heerd said the hangman pulling off his hat to take his handkerchief from the crown and wipe his face and then putting it on again a little more on one side than before I ve heerd a eloquence on them boards you know what boards I mean and have heerd a degree of mouth given to them speeches that they was as clear as a bell and as good as a play There s a pattern And always when a thing of this natur s to come off what I stand up for is a proper frame of mind Let s have a proper frame of mind and we can go through with it creditable pleasant sociable Whatever you do and I address myself in particular to you in the furthest never snivel I d sooner by half though I lose by it see a man tear his clothes a purpose to spile em before they come to me than find him snivelling It s ten to one a better frame of mind every way While the hangman addressed them to this effect in the tone and with the air of a pastor in familiar conversation with his flock the noise had been in some degree subdued for the rioters were busy in conveying the prisoners to the Sessions House which was beyond the main walls of the prison though connected with it and the crowd were busy too in passing them from thence along the street But when he had got thus far in his discourse the sound of voices in the yard showed plainly that the mob had returned and were coming that way and directly afterwards a violent crashing at the grate below gave note of their attack upon the cells as they were called at last It was in vain the hangman ran from door to door and covered the grates one after another with his hat in futile efforts to stifle the cries of the four men within it was in vain he dogged their outstretched hands and beat them with his stick or menaced them with new and lingering pains in the execution of his office the place resounded with their cries These together with the feeling that they were now the last men in the jail so worked upon and stimulated the besiegers that in an incredibly short space of time they forced the strong grate down below which was formed of iron rods two inches square drove in the two other doors as if they had been but deal partitions and stood at the end of the gallery with only a bar or two between them and the cells Halloa cried Hugh who was the first to look into the dusky passage Dennis before us Well done old boy Be quick and open here for we shall be suffocated in the smoke going out Go out at once then said Dennis What do you want here Want echoed Hugh The four men Four devils cried the hangman Don t you know they re left for death on Thursday Don t you respect the law the constitootion nothing Let the four men be Is this a time for joking cried Hugh Do you hear em Pull away these bars that have got fixed between the door and the ground and let us in Brother said the hangman in a low voice as he stooped under pretence of doing what Hugh desired but only looked up in his face can t you leave these here four men to me if I ve the whim You do what you like and have what you like of everything for your share give me my share I want these four men left alone I tell you Pull the bars down or stand out of the way was Hugh s reply You can turn the crowd if you like you know that well enough brother said the hangman slowly What You WILL come in will you Yes You won t let these men alone and leave em to me You ve no respect for nothing haven t you said the hangman retreating to the door by which he had entered and regarding his companion with a scowl You WILL come in will you brother I tell you yes What the devil ails you Where are you going No matter where I m going rejoined the hangman looking in again at the iron wicket which he had nearly shut upon himself and held ajar Remember where you re coming That s all With that he shook his likeness at Hugh and giving him a grin compared with which his usual smile was amiable disappeared and shut the door Hugh paused no longer but goaded alike by the cries of the convicts and by the impatience of the crowd warned the man immediately behind him the way was only wide enough for one abreast to stand back and wielded a sledge hammer with such strength that after a few blows the iron bent and broke and gave them free admittance It the two sons of one of these men of whom mention has been made were furious in their zeal before they had now the wrath and vigour of lions Calling to the man within each cell to keep as far back as he could lest the axes crashing through the door should wound him a party went to work upon each one to beat it in by sheer strength and force the bolts and staples from their hold But although these two lads had the weakest party and the worst armed and did not begin until after the others having stopped to whisper to him through the grate that door was the first open and that man was the first out As they dragged him into the gallery to knock off his irons he fell down among them a mere heap of chains and was carried out in that state on men s shoulders with no sign of life The release of these four wretched creatures and conveying them astounded and bewildered into the streets so full of life a spectacle they had never thought to see again until they emerged from solitude and silence upon that last journey when the air should be heavy with the pent up breath of thousands and the streets and houses should be built and roofed with human faces not with bricks and tiles and stones was the crowning horror of the scene Their pale and haggard looks and hollow eyes their staggering feet and hands stretched out as if to save themselves from falling their wandering and uncertain air the way they heaved and gasped for breath as though in water when they were first plunged into the crowd all marked them for the men No need to say this one was doomed to die for there were the words broadly stamped and branded on his face The crowd fell off as if they had been laid out for burial and had risen in their shrouds and many were seen to shudder as though they had been actually dead men when they chanced to touch or brush against their garments At the bidding of the mob the houses were all illuminated that night lighted up from top to bottom as at a time of public gaiety and joy Many years afterwards old people who lived in their youth near this part of the city remembered being in a great glare of light within doors and without and as they looked timid and frightened children from the windows seeing a FACE go by Though the whole great crowd and all its other terrors had faded from their recollection this one object remained alone distinct and well remembered Even in the unpractised minds of infants one of these doomed men darting past and but an instant seen was an image of force enough to dim the whole concourse to find itself an all absorbing place and hold it ever after When this last task had been achieved the shouts and cries grew fainter the clank of fetters which had resounded on all sides as the prisoners escaped was heard no more all the noises of the crowd subsided into a hoarse and sullen murmur as it passed into the distance and when the human tide had rolled away a melancholy heap of smoking ruins marked the spot where it had lately chafed and roared Chapter 66 Although he had had no rest upon the previous night and had watched with little intermission for some weeks past sleeping only in the day by starts and snatches Mr Haredale from the dawn of morning until sunset sought his niece in every place where he deemed it possible she could have taken refuge All day long nothing save a draught of water passed his lips though he prosecuted his inquiries far and wide and never so much as sat down once In every quarter he could think of at Chigwell and in London at the houses of the tradespeople with whom he dealt and of the friends he knew he pursued his search A prey to the most harrowing anxieties and apprehensions he went from magistrate to magistrate and finally to the Secretary of State The only comfort he received was from this minister who assured him that the Government being now driven to the exercise of the extreme prerogatives of the Crown were determined to exert them that a proclamation would probably be out upon the morrow giving to the military discretionary and unlimited power in the suppression of the riots that the sympathies of the King the Administration and both Houses of Parliament and indeed of all good men of every religious persuasion were strongly with the injured Catholics and that justice should be done them at any cost or hazard He told him moreover that other persons whose houses had been burnt had for a time lost sight of their children or their relatives but had in every case within his knowledge succeeded in discovering them that his complaint should be remembered and fully stated in the instructions given to the officers in command and to all the inferior myrmidons of justice and that everything that could be done to help him should be done with a goodwill and in good faith Grateful for this consolation feeble as it was in its reference to the past and little hope as it afforded him in connection with the subject of distress which lay nearest to his heart and really thankful for the interest the minister expressed and seemed to feel in his condition Mr Haredale withdrew He found himself with the night coming on alone in the streets and destitute of any place in which to lay his head He entered an hotel near Charing Cross and ordered some refreshment and a bed He saw that his faint and worn appearance attracted the attention of the landlord and his waiters and thinking that they might suppose him to be penniless took out his purse and laid it on the table It was not that the landlord said in a faltering voice If he were one of those who had suffered by the rioters he durst not give him entertainment He had a family of children and had been twice warned to be careful in receiving guests He heartily prayed his forgiveness but what could he do Nothing No man felt that more sincerely than Mr Haredale He told the man as much and left the house Feeling that he might have anticipated this occurrence after what he had seen at Chigwell in the morning where no man dared to touch a spade though he offered a large reward to all who would come and dig among the ruins of his house he walked along the Strand too proud to expose himself to another refusal and of too generous a spirit to involve in distress or ruin any honest tradesman who might be weak enough to give him shelter He wandered into one of the streets by the side of the river and was pacing in a thoughtful manner up and down thinking of things that had happened long ago when he heard a servant man at an upper window call to another on the opposite side of the street that the mob were setting fire to Newgate To Newgate where that man was His failing strength returned his energies came back with tenfold vigour on the instant If it were possible if they should set the murderer free was he after all he had undergone to die with the suspicion of having slain his own brother dimly gathering about him He had no consciousness of going to the jail but there he stood before it There was the crowd wedged and pressed together in a dense dark moving mass and there were the flames soaring up into the air His head turned round and round lights flashed before his eyes and he struggled hard with two men Nay nay said one Be more yourself my good sir We attract attention here Come away What can you do among so many men The gentleman s always for doing something said the other forcing him along as he spoke I like him for that I do like him for that They had by this time got him into a court hard by the prison He looked from one to the other and as he tried to release himself felt that he tottered on his feet He who had spoken first was the old gentleman whom he had seen at the Lord Mayor s The other was John Grueby who had stood by him so manfully at Westminster What does this mean he asked them faintly How came we together On the skirts of the crowd returned the distiller but come with us Pray come with us You seem to know my friend here Surely said Mr Haredale looking in a kind of stupor at John He ll tell you then returned the old gentleman that I am a man to be trusted He s my servant He was lately as you know I have no doubt in Lord George Gordon s service but he left it and brought in pure goodwill to me and others who are marked by the rioters such intelligence as he had picked up of their designs On one condition please sir said John touching his hat No evidence against my lord a misled man a kind hearted man sir My lord never intended this The condition will be observed of course rejoined the old distiller It s a point of honour But come with us sir pray come with us John Grueby added no entreaties but he adopted a different kind of persuasion by putting his arm through one of Mr Haredale s while his master took the other and leading him away with all speed Sensible from a strange lightness in his head and a difficulty in fixing his thoughts on anything even to the extent of bearing his companions in his mind for a minute together without looking at them that his brain was affected by the agitation and suffering through which he had passed and to which he was still a prey Mr Haredale let them lead him where they would As they went along he was conscious of having no command over what he said or thought and that he had a fear of going mad The distiller lived as he had told him when they first met on Holborn Hill where he had great storehouses and drove a large trade They approached his house by a back entrance lest they should attract the notice of the crowd and went into an upper room which faced towards the street the windows however in common with those of every other room in the house were boarded up inside in order that out of doors all might appear quite dark They laid him on a sofa in this chamber perfectly insensible but John immediately fetching a surgeon who took from him a large quantity of blood he gradually came to himself As he was for the time too weak to walk they had no difficulty in persuading him to remain there all night and got him to bed without loss of a minute That done they gave him cordial and some toast and presently a pretty strong composing draught under the influence of which he soon fell into a lethargy and for a time forgot his troubles The vintner who was a very hearty old fellow and a worthy man had no thoughts of going to bed himself for he had received several threatening warnings from the rioters and had indeed gone out that evening to try and gather from the conversation of the mob whether his house was to be the next attacked He sat all night in an easy chair in the same room dozing a little now and then and received from time to time the reports of John Grueby and two or three other trustworthy persons in his employ who went out into the streets as scouts and for whose entertainment an ample allowance of good cheer which the old vintner despite his anxiety now and then attacked himself was set forth in an adjoining chamber These accounts were of a sufficiently alarming nature from the first but as the night wore on they grew so much worse and involved such a fearful amount of riot and destruction that in comparison with these new tidings all the previous disturbances sunk to nothing The first intelligence that came was of the taking of Newgate and the escape of all the prisoners whose track as they made up Holborn and into the adjacent streets was proclaimed to those citizens who were shut up in their houses by the rattling of their chains which formed a dismal concert and was heard in every direction as though so many forges were at work The flames too shone so brightly through the vintner s skylights that the rooms and staircases below were nearly as light as in broad day while the distant shouting of the mob seemed to shake the very walls and ceilings At length they were heard approaching the house and some minutes of terrible anxiety ensued They came close up and stopped before it but after giving three loud yells went on And although they returned several times that night creating new alarms each time they did nothing there having their hands full Shortly after they had gone away for the first time one of the scouts came running in with the news that they had stopped before Lord Mansfield s house in Bloomsbury Square Soon afterwards there came another and another and then the first returned again and so by little and little their tale was this That the mob gathering round Lord Mansfield s house had called on those within to open the door and receiving no reply for Lord and Lady Mansfield were at that moment escaping by the backway forced an entrance according to their usual custom That they then began to demolish the house with great fury and setting fire to it in several parts involved in a common ruin the whole of the costly furniture the plate and jewels a beautiful gallery of pictures the rarest collection of manuscripts ever possessed by any one private person in the world and worse than all because nothing could replace this loss the great Law Library on almost every page of which were notes in the Judge s own hand of inestimable value being the results of the study and experience of his whole life That while they were howling and exulting round the fire a troop of soldiers with a magistrate among them came up and being too late for the mischief was by that time done began to disperse the crowd That the Riot Act being read and the crowd still resisting the soldiers received orders to fire and levelling their muskets shot dead at the first discharge six men and a woman and wounded many persons and loading again directly fired another volley but over the people s heads it was supposed as none were seen to fall That thereupon and daunted by the shrieks and tumult the crowd began to disperse and the soldiers went away leaving the killed and wounded on the ground which they had no sooner done than the rioters came back again and taking up the dead bodies and the wounded people formed into a rude procession having the bodies in the front That in this order they paraded off with a horrible merriment fixing weapons in the dead men s hands to make them look as if alive and preceded by a fellow ringing Lord Mansfield s dinner bell with all his might The scouts reported further that this party meeting with some others who had been at similar work elsewhere they all united into one and drafting off a few men with the killed and wounded marched away to Lord Mansfield s country seat at Caen Wood between Hampstead and Highgate bent upon destroying that house likewise and lighting up a great fire there which from that height should be seen all over London But in this they were disappointed for a party of horse having arrived before them they retreated faster than they went and came straight back to town There being now a great many parties in the streets each went to work according to its humour and a dozen houses were quickly blazing including those of Sir John Fielding and two other justices and four in Holborn one of the greatest thoroughfares in London which were all burning at the same time and burned until they went out of themselves for the people cut the engine hose and would not suffer the firemen to play upon the flames At one house near Moorfields they found in one of the rooms some canary birds in cages and these they cast into the fire alive The poor little creatures screamed it was said like infants when they were flung upon the blaze and one man was so touched that he tried in vain to save them which roused the indignation of the crowd and nearly cost him his life At this same house one of the fellows who went through the rooms breaking the furniture and helping to destroy the building found a child s doll a poor toy which he exhibited at the window to the mob below as the image of some unholy saint which the late occupants had worshipped While he was doing this another man with an equally tender conscience they had both been foremost in throwing down the canary birds for roasting alive took his seat on the parapet of the house and harangued the crowd from a pamphlet circulated by the Association relative to the true principles of Christianity Meanwhile the Lord Mayor with his hands in his pockets looked on as an idle man might look at any other show and seemed mightily satisfied to have got a good place Such were the accounts brought to the old vintner by his servants as he sat at the side of Mr Haredale s bed having been unable even to doze after the first part of the night too much disturbed by his own fears by the cries of the mob the light of the fires and the firing of the soldiers Such with the addition of the release of all the prisoners in the New Jail at Clerkenwell and as many robberies of passengers in the streets as the crowd had leisure to indulge in were the scenes of which Mr Haredale was happily unconscious and which were all enacted before midnight Chapter 67 When darkness broke away and morning began to dawn the town wore a strange aspect indeed Sleep had hardly been thought of all night The general alarm was so apparent in the faces of the inhabitants and its expression was so aggravated by want of rest few persons with any property to lose having dared go to bed since Monday that a stranger coming into the streets would have supposed some mortal pest or plague to have been raging In place of the usual cheerfulness and animation of morning everything was dead and silent The shops remained closed offices and warehouses were shut the coach and chair stands were deserted no carts or waggons rumbled through the slowly waking streets the early cries were all hushed a universal gloom prevailed Great numbers of people were out even at daybreak but they flitted to and fro as though they shrank from the sound of their own footsteps the public ways were haunted rather than frequented and round the smoking ruins people stood apart from one another and in silence not venturing to condemn the rioters or to be supposed to do so even in whispers At the Lord President s in Piccadilly at Lambeth Palace at the Lord Chancellor s in Great Ormond Street in the Royal Exchange the Bank the Guildhall the Inns of Court the Courts of Law and every chamber fronting the streets near Westminster Hall and the Houses of Parliament parties of soldiers were posted before daylight A body of Horse Guards paraded Palace Yard an encampment was formed in the Park where fifteen hundred men and five battalions of Militia were under arms the Tower was fortified the drawbridges were raised the cannon loaded and pointed and two regiments of artillery busied in strengthening the fortress and preparing it for defence A numerous detachment of soldiers were stationed to keep guard at the New River Head which the people had threatened to attack and where it was said they meant to cut off the main pipes so that there might be no water for the extinction of the flames In the Poultry and on Cornhill and at several other leading points iron chains were drawn across the street parties of soldiers were distributed in some of the old city churches while it was yet dark and in several private houses among them Lord Rockingham s in Grosvenor Square which were blockaded as though to sustain a siege and had guns pointed from the windows When the sun rose it shone into handsome apartments filled with armed men the furniture hastily heaped away in corners and made of little or no account in the terror of the time on arms glittering in city chambers among desks and stools and dusty books into little smoky churchyards in odd lanes and by ways with soldiers lying down among the tombs or lounging under the shade of the one old tree and their pile of muskets sparkling in the light on solitary sentries pacing up and down in courtyards silent now but yesterday resounding with the din and hum of business everywhere on guard rooms garrisons and threatening preparations As the day crept on still more unusual sights were witnessed in the streets The gates of the King s Bench and Fleet Prisons being opened at the usual hour were found to have notices affixed to them announcing that the rioters would come that night to burn them down The wardens too well knowing the likelihood there was of this promise being fulfilled were fain to set their prisoners at liberty and give them leave to move their goods so all day such of them as had any furniture were occupied in conveying it some to this place some to that and not a few to the brokers shops where they gladly sold it for any wretched price those gentry chose to give There were some broken men among these debtors who had been in jail so long and were so miserable and destitute of friends so dead to the world and utterly forgotten and uncared for that they implored their jailers not to set them free and to send them if need were to some other place of custody But they refusing to comply lest they should incur the anger of the mob turned them into the streets where they wandered up and down hardly remembering the ways untrodden by their feet so long and crying such abject things those rotten hearted jails had made them as they slunk off in their rags and dragged their slipshod feet along the pavement Even of the three hundred prisoners who had escaped from Newgate there were some a few but there were some who sought their jailers out and delivered themselves up preferring imprisonment and punishment to the horrors of such another night as the last Many of the convicts drawn back to their old place of captivity by some indescribable attraction or by a desire to exult over it in its downfall and glut their revenge by seeing it in ashes actually went back in broad noon and loitered about the cells Fifty were retaken at one time on this next day within the prison walls but their fate did not deter others for there they went in spite of everything and there they were taken in twos and threes twice or thrice a day all through the week Of the fifty just mentioned some were occupied in endeavouring to rekindle the fire but in general they seemed to have no object in view but to prowl and lounge about the old place being often found asleep in the ruins or sitting talking there or even eating and drinking as in a choice retreat Besides the notices on the gates of the Fleet and the King s Bench many similar announcements were left before one o clock at noon at the houses of private individuals and further the mob proclaimed their intention of seizing on the Bank the Mint the Arsenal at Woolwich and the Royal Palaces The notices were seldom delivered by more than one man who if it were at a shop went in and laid it with a bloody threat perhaps upon the counter or if it were at a private house knocked at the door and thrust it in the servant s hand Notwithstanding the presence of the military in every quarter of the town and the great force in the Park these messengers did their errands with impunity all through the day So did two boys who went down Holborn alone armed with bars taken from the railings of Lord Mansfield s house and demanded money for the rioters So did a tall man on horseback who made a collection for the same purpose in Fleet Street and refused to take anything but gold A rumour had now got into circulation too which diffused a greater dread all through London even than these publicly announced intentions of the rioters though all men knew that if they were successfully effected there must ensue a national bankruptcy and general ruin It was said that they meant to throw the gates of Bedlam open and let all the madmen loose This suggested such dreadful images to the people s minds and was indeed an act so fraught with new and unimaginable horrors in the contemplation that it beset them more than any loss or cruelty of which they could foresee the worst and drove many sane men nearly mad themselves So the day passed on the prisoners moving their goods people running to and fro in the streets carrying away their property groups standing in silence round the ruins all business suspended and the soldiers disposed as has been already mentioned remaining quite inactive So the day passed on and dreaded night drew near again At last at seven o clock in the evening the Privy Council issued a solemn proclamation that it was now necessary to employ the military and that the officers had most direct and effectual orders by an immediate exertion of their utmost force to repress the disturbances and warning all good subjects of the King to keep themselves their servants and apprentices within doors that night There was then delivered out to every soldier on duty thirty six rounds of powder and ball the drums beat and the whole force was under arms at sunset The City authorities stimulated by these vigorous measures held a Common Council passed a vote thanking the military associations who had tendered their aid to the civil authorities accepted it and placed them under the direction of the two sheriffs At the Queen s palace a double guard the yeomen on duty the groom porters and all other attendants were stationed in the passages and on the staircases at seven o clock with strict instructions to be watchful on their posts all night and all the doors were locked The gentlemen of the Temple and the other Inns mounted guard within their gates and strengthened them with the great stones of the pavement which they took up for the purpose In Lincoln s Inn they gave up the hall and commons to the Northumberland Militia under the command of Lord Algernon Percy in some few of the city wards the burgesses turned out and without making a very fierce show looked brave enough Some hundreds of stout gentlemen threw themselves armed to the teeth into the halls of the different companies double locked and bolted all the gates and dared the rioters among themselves to come on at their peril These arrangements being all made simultaneously or nearly so were completed by the time it got dark and then the streets were comparatively clear and were guarded at all the great corners and chief avenues by the troops while parties of the officers rode up and down in all directions ordering chance stragglers home and admonishing the residents to keep within their houses and if any firing ensued not to approach the windows More chains were drawn across such of the thoroughfares as were of a nature to favour the approach of a great crowd and at each of these points a considerable force was stationed All these precautions having been taken and it being now quite dark those in command awaited the result in some anxiety and not without a hope that such vigilant demonstrations might of themselves dishearten the populace and prevent any new outrages But in this reckoning they were cruelly mistaken for in half an hour or less as though the setting in of night had been their preconcerted signal the rioters having previously in small parties prevented the lighting of the street lamps rose like a great sea and that in so many places at once and with such inconceivable fury that those who had the direction of the troops knew not at first where to turn or what to do One after another new fires blazed up in every quarter of the town as though it were the intention of the insurgents to wrap the city in a circle of flames which contracting by degrees should burn the whole to ashes the crowd swarmed and roared in every street and none but rioters and soldiers being out of doors it seemed to the latter as if all London were arrayed against them and they stood alone against the town In two hours six and thirty fires were raging six and thirty great conflagrations among them the Borough Clink in Tooley Street the King s Bench the Fleet and the New Bridewell In almost every street there was a battle and in every quarter the muskets of the troops were heard above the shouts and tumult of the mob The firing began in the Poultry where the chain was drawn across the road where nearly a score of people were killed on the first discharge Their bodies having been hastily carried into St Mildred s Church by the soldiers the latter fired again and following fast upon the crowd who began to give way when they saw the execution that was done formed across Cheapside and charged them at the point of the bayonet The streets were now a dreadful spectacle The shouts of the rabble the shrieks of women the cries of the wounded and the constant firing formed a deafening and an awful accompaniment to the sights which every corner presented Wherever the road was obstructed by the chains there the fighting and the loss of life were greatest but there was hot work and bloodshed in almost every leading thoroughfare At Holborn Bridge and on Holborn Hill the confusion was greater than in any other part for the crowd that poured out of the city in two great streams one by Ludgate Hill and one by Newgate Street united at that spot and formed a mass so dense that at every volley the people seemed to fall in heaps At this place a large detachment of soldiery were posted who fired now up Fleet Market now up Holborn now up Snow Hill constantly raking the streets in each direction At this place too several large fires were burning so that all the terrors of that terrible night seemed to be concentrated in one spot Full twenty times the rioters headed by one man who wielded an axe in his right hand and bestrode a brewer s horse of great size and strength caparisoned with fetters taken out of Newgate which clanked and jingled as he went made an attempt to force a passage at this point and fire the vintner s house Full twenty times they were repulsed with loss of life and still came back again and though the fellow at their head was marked and singled out by all and was a conspicuous object as the only rioter on horseback not a man could hit him So surely as the smoke cleared away so surely there was he calling hoarsely to his companions brandishing his axe above his head and dashing on as though he bore a charmed life and was proof against ball and powder This man was Hugh and in every part of the riot he was seen He headed two attacks upon the Bank helped to break open the Toll houses on Blackfriars Bridge and cast the money into the street fired two of the prisons with his own hand was here and there and everywhere always foremost always active striking at the soldiers cheering on the crowd making his horse s iron music heard through all the yell and uproar but never hurt or stopped Turn him at one place and he made a new struggle in anotlter force him to retreat at this point and he advanced on that directly Driven from Holborn for the twentieth time he rode at the head of a great crowd straight upon Saint Paul s attacked a guard of soldiers who kept watch over a body of prisoners within the iron railings forced them to retreat rescued the men they had in custody and with this accession to his party came back again mad with liquor and excitement and hallooing them on like a demon It would have been no easy task for the most careful rider to sit a horse in the midst of such a throng and tumult but though this madman rolled upon his back he had no saddle like a boat upon the sea he never for an instant lost his seat or failed to guide him where he would Through the very thickest of the press over dead bodies and burning fragments now on the pavement now in the road now riding up a flight of steps to make himself the more conspicuous to his party and now forcing a passage through a mass of human beings so closely squeezed together that it seemed as if the edge of a knife would scarcely part them on he went as though he could surmount all obstacles by the mere exercise of his will And perhaps his not being shot was in some degree attributable to this very circumstance for his extreme audacity and the conviction that he must be one of those to whom the proclamation referred inspired the soldiers with a desire to take him alive and diverted many an aim which otherwise might have been more near the mark The vintner and Mr Haredale unable to sit quietly listening to the noise without seeing what went on had climbed to the roof of the house and hiding behind a stack of chimneys were looking cautiously down into the street almost hoping that after so many repulses the rioters would be foiled when a great shout proclaimed that a parry were coming round the other way and the dismal jingling of those accursed fetters warned them next moment that they too were led by Hugh The soldiers had advanced into Fleet Market and were dispersing the people there so that they came on with hardly any check and were soon before the house All s over now said the vintner Fifty thousand pounds will be scattered in a minute We must save ourselves We can do no more and shall have reason to be thankful if we do as much Their first impulse was to clamber along the roofs of the houses and knocking at some garret window for admission pass down that way into the street and so escape But another fierce cry from below and a general upturning of the faces of the crowd apprised them that they were discovered and even that Mr Haredale was recognised for Hugh seeing him plainly in the bright glare of the fire which in that part made it as light as day called to him by his name and swore to have his life Leave me here said Mr Haredale and in Heaven s name my good friend save yourself Come on he muttered as he turned towards Hugh and faced him without any further effort at concealment This roof is high and if we close we will die together Madness said the honest vintner pulling him back sheer madness Hear reason sir My good sir hear reason I could never make myself heard by knocking at a window now and even if I could no one would be bold enough to connive at my escape Through the cellars there s a kind of passage into the back street by which we roll casks in and out We shall have time to get down there before they can force an entry Do not delay an instant but come with me for both our sakes for mine my dear good sir As he spoke and drew Mr Haredale back they had both a glimpse of the street It was but a glimpse but it showed them the crowd gathering and clustering round the house some of the armed men pressing to the front to break down the doors and windows some bringing brands from the nearest fire some with lifted faces following their course upon the roof and pointing them out to their companions all raging and roaring like the flames they lighted up They saw some men thirsting for the treasures of strong liquor which they knew were stored within they saw others who had been wounded sinking down into the opposite doorways and dying solitary wretches in the midst of all the vast assemblage here a frightened woman trying to escape and there a lost child and there a drunken ruffian unconscious of the death wound on his head raving and fighting to the last All these things and even such trivial incidents as a man with his hat off or turning round or stooping down or shaking hands with another they marked distinctly yet in a glance so brief that in the act of stepping back they lost the whole and saw but the pale faces of each other and the red sky above them Mr Haredale yielded to the entreaties of his companion more because he was resolved to defend him than for any thought he had of his own life or any care he entertained for his own safety and quickly re entering the house they descended the stairs together Loud blows were thundering on the shutters crowbars were already thrust beneath the door the glass fell from the sashes a deep light shone through every crevice and they heard the voices of the foremost in the crowd so close to every chink and keyhole that they seemed to be hoarsely whispering their threats into their very ears They had but a moment reached the bottom of the cellar steps and shut the door behind them when the mob broke in The vaults were profoundly dark and having no torch or candle for they had been afraid to carry one lest it should betray their place of refuge they were obliged to grope with their hands But they were not long without light for they had not gone far when they heard the crowd forcing the door and looking back among the low arched passages could see them in the distance hurrying to and fro with flashing links broaching the casks staving the great vats turning off upon the right hand and the left into the different cellars and lying down to drink at the channels of strong spirits which were already flowing on the ground They hurried on not the less quickly for this and had reached the only vault which lay between them and the passage out when suddenly from the direction in which they were going a strong light gleamed upon their faces and before they could slip aside or turn back or hide themselves two men one bearing a torch came upon them and cried in an astonished whisper Here they are At the same instant they pulled off what they wore upon their heads Mr Haredale saw before him Edward Chester and then saw when the vintner gasped his name Joe Willet Ay the same Joe though with an arm the less who used to make the quarterly journey on the grey mare to pay the bill to the purple faced vintner and that very same purple faced vintner formerly of Thames Street now looked him in the face and challenged him by name Give me your hand said Joe softly taking it whether the astonished vintner would or no Don t fear to shake it it s a friendly one and a hearty one though it has no fellow Why how well you look and how bluff you are And you God bless you sir Take heart take heart We ll find them Be of good cheer we have not been idle There was something so honest and frank in Joe s speech that Mr Haredale put his hand in his involuntarily though their meeting was suspicious enough But his glance at Edward Chester and that gentleman s keeping aloof were not lost upon Joe who said bluntly glancing at Edward while he spoke Times are changed Mr Haredale and times have come when we ought to know friends from enemies and make no confusion of names Let me tell you that but for this gentleman you would most likely have been dead by this time or badly wounded at the best What do you say cried Mr Haredale I say said Joe first that it was a bold thing to be in the crowd at all disguised as one of them though I won t say much about that on second thoughts for that s my case too Secondly that it was a brave and glorious action that s what I call it to strike that fellow off his horse before their eyes What fellow Whose eyes What fellow sir cried Joe a fellow who has no goodwill to you and who has the daring and devilry in him of twenty fellows I know him of old Once in the house HE would have found you here or anywhere The rest owe you no particular grudge and unless they see you will only think of drinking themselves dead But we lose time Are you ready Quite said Edward Put out the torch Joe and go on And be silent there s a good fellow Silent or not silent murmured Joe as he dropped the flaring link upon the ground crushed it with his foot and gave his hand to Mr Haredale it was a brave and glorious action no man can alter that Both Mr Haredale and the worthy vintner were too amazed and too much hurried to ask any further questions so followed their conductors in silence It seemed from a short whispering which presently ensued between them and the vintner relative to the best way of escape that they had entered by the back door with the connivance of John Grueby who watched outside with the key in his pocket and whom they had taken into their confidence A party of the crowd coming up that way just as they entered John had double locked the door again and made off for the soldiers so that means of retreat was cut off from under them However as the front door had been forced and this minor crowd being anxious to get at the liquor had no fancy for losing time in breaking down another but had gone round and got in from Holborn with the rest the narrow lane in the rear was quite free of people So when they had crawled through the passage indicated by the vintner which was a mere shelving trap for the admission of casks and had managed with some difficulty to unchain and raise the door at the upper end they emerged into the street without being observed or interrupted Joe still holding Mr Haredale tight and Edward taking the same care of the vintner they hurried through the streets at a rapid pace occasionally standing aside to let some fugitives go by or to keep out of the way of the soldiers who followed them and whose questions when they halted to put any were speedily stopped by one whispered word from Joe Chapter 68 While Newgate was burning on the previous night Barnaby and his father having been passed among the crowd from hand to hand stood in Smithfield on the outskirts of the mob gazing at the flames like men who had been suddenly roused from sleep Some moments elapsed before they could distinctly remember where they were or how they got there or recollected that while they were standing idle and listless spectators of the fire they had tools in their hands which had been hurriedly given them that they might free themselves from their fetters Barnaby heavily ironed as he was if he had obeyed his first impulse or if he had been alone would have made his way back to the side of Hugh who to his clouded intellect now shone forth with the new lustre of being his preserver and truest friend But his father s terror of remaining in the streets communicated itself to him when he comprehended the full extent of his fears and impressed him with the same eagerness to fly to a place of safety In a corner of the market among the pens for cattle Barnaby knelt down and pausing every now and then to pass his hand over his father s face or look up to him with a smile knocked off his irons When he had seen him spring a free man to his feet and had given vent to the transport of delight which the sight awakened he went to work upon his own which soon fell rattling down upon the ground and left his limbs unfettered Gliding away together when this task was accomplished and passing several groups of men each gathered round a stooping figure to hide him from those who passed but unable to repress the clanking sound of hammers which told that they too were busy at the same work the two fugitives made towards Clerkenwell and passing thence to Islington as the nearest point of egress were quickly in the fields After wandering about for a long time they found in a pasture near Finchley a poor shed with walls of mud and roof of grass and brambles built for some cowherd but now deserted Here they lay down for the rest of the night They wandered to and fro when it was day and once Barnaby went off alone to a cluster of little cottages two or three miles away to purchase some bread and milk But finding no better shelter they returned to the same place and lay down again to wait for night Heaven alone can tell with what vague hopes of duty and affection with what strange promptings of nature intelligible to him as to a man of radiant mind and most enlarged capacity with what dim memories of children he had played with when a child himself who had prattled of their fathers and of loving them and being loved with how many half remembered dreamy associations of his mother s grief and tears and widowhood he watched and tended this man But that a vague and shadowy crowd of such ideas came slowly on him that they taught him to be sorry when he looked upon his haggard face that they overflowed his eyes when he stooped to kiss him that they kept him waking in a tearful gladness shading him from the sun fanning him with leaves soothing him when he started in his sleep ah what a troubled sleep it was and wondering when SHE would come to join them and be happy is the truth He sat beside him all that day listening for her footsteps in every breath of air looking for her shadow on the gently waving grass twining the hedge flowers for her pleasure when she came and his when he awoke and stooping down from time to time to listen to his mutterings and wonder why he was so restless in that quiet place The sun went down and night came on and he was still quite tranquil busied with these thoughts as if there were no other people in the world and the dull cloud of smoke hanging on the immense city in the distance hid no vices no crimes no life or death or cause of disquiet nothing but clear air But the hour had now come when he must go alone to find out the blind man a task that filled him with delight and bring him to that place taking especial care that he was not watched or followed on his way back He listened to the directions he must observe repeated them again and again and after twice or thrice returning to surprise his father with a light hearted laugh went forth at last upon his errand leaving Grip whom he had carried from the jail in his arms to his care Fleet of foot and anxious to return he sped swiftly on towards the city but could not reach it before the fires began and made the night angry with their dismal lustre When he entered the town it might be that he was changed by going there without his late companions and on no violent errand or by the beautiful solitude in which he had passed the day or by the thoughts that had come upon him but it seemed peopled by a legion of devils This flight and pursuit this cruel burning and destroying these dreadful cries and stunning noises were THEY the good lord s noble cause Though almost stupefied by the bewildering scene still be found the blind man s house It was shut up and tenantless He waited for a long while but no one came At last he withdrew and as he knew by this time that the soldiers were firing and many people must have been killed he went down into Holborn where he heard the great crowd was to try if he could find Hugh and persuade him to avoid the danger and return with him If he had been stunned and shocked before his horror was increased a thousandfold when he got into this vortex of the riot and not being an actor in the terrible spectacle had it all before his eyes But there in the midst towering above them all close before the house they were attacking now was Hugh on horseback calling to the rest Sickened by the sights surrounding him on every side and by the heat and roar and crash he forced his way among the crowd where many recognised him and with shouts pressed back to let him pass and in time was nearly up with Hugh who was savagely threatening some one but whom or what he said he could not in the great confusion understand At that moment the crowd forced their way into the house and Hugh it was impossible to see by what means in such a concourse fell headlong down Barnaby was beside him when he staggered to his feet It was well he made him hear his voice or Hugh with his uplifted axe would have cleft his skull in twain Barnaby you Whose hand was that that struck me down Not mine Whose I say whose he cried reeling back and looking wildly round What are you doing Where is he Show me You are hurt said Barnaby as indeed he was in the head both by the blow he had received and by his horse s hoof Come away with me As he spoke he took the horse s bridle in his hand turned him and dragged Hugh several paces This brought them out of the crowd which was pouring from the street into the vintner s cellars Where s where s Dennis said Hugh coming to a stop and checking Barnaby with his strong arm Where has he been all day What did he mean by leaving me as he did in the jail last night Tell me you d ye hear With a flourish of his dangerous weapon he fell down upon the ground like a log After a minute though already frantic with drinking and with the wound in his head he crawled to a stream of burning spirit which was pouring down the kennel and began to drink at it as if it were a brook of water Barnaby drew him away and forced him to rise Though he could neither stand nor walk he involuntarily staggered to his horse climbed upon his back and clung there After vainly attempting to divest the animal of his clanking trappings Barnaby sprung up behind him snatched the bridle turned into Leather Lane which was close at hand and urged the frightened horse into a heavy trot He looked back once before he left the street and looked upon a sight not easily to be erased even from his remembrance so long as he had life The vintner s house with a half a dozen others near at hand was one great glowing blaze All night no one had essayed to quench the flames or stop their progress but now a body of soldiers were actively engaged in pulling down two old wooden houses which were every moment in danger of taking fire and which could scarcely fail if they were left to burn to extend the conflagration immensely The tumbling down of nodding walls and heavy blocks of wood the hooting and the execrations of the crowd the distant firing of other military detachments the distracted looks and cries of those whose habitations were in danger the hurrying to and fro of frightened people with their goods the reflections in every quarter of the sky of deep red soaring flames as though the last day had come and the whole universe were burning the dust and smoke and drift of fiery particles scorching and kindling all it fell upon the hot unwholesome vapour the blight on everything the stars and moon and very sky obliterated made up such a sum of dreariness and ruin that it seemed as if the face of Heaven were blotted out and night in its rest and quiet and softened light never could look upon the earth again But there was a worse spectacle than this worse by far than fire and smoke or even the rabble s unappeasable and maniac rage The gutters of the street and every crack and fissure in the stones ran with scorching spirit which being dammed up by busy hands overflowed the road and pavement and formed a great pool into which the people dropped down dead by dozens They lay in heaps all round this fearful pond husbands and wives fathers and sons mothers and daughters women with children in their arms and babies at their breasts and drank until they died While some stooped with their lips to the brink and never raised their heads again others sprang up from their fiery draught and danced half in a mad triumph and half in the agony of suffocation until they fell and steeped their corpses in the liquor that had killed them Nor was even this the worst or most appalling kind of death that happened on this fatal night From the burning cellars where they drank out of hats pails buckets tubs and shoes some men were drawn alive but all alight from head to foot who in their unendurable anguish and suffering making for anything that had the look of water rolled hissing in this hideous lake and splashed up liquid fire which lapped in all it met with as it ran along the surface and neither spared the living nor the dead On this last night of the great riots for the last night it was the wretched victims of a senseless outcry became themselves the dust and ashes of the flames they had kindled and strewed the public streets of London With all he saw in this last glance fixed indelibly upon his mind Barnaby hurried from the city which enclosed such horrors and holding down his head that he might not even see the glare of the fires upon the quiet landscape was soon in the still country roads He stopped at about half a mile from the shed where his father lay and with some difficulty making Hugh sensible that he must dismount sunk the horse s furniture in a pool of stagnant water and turned the animal loose That done he supported his companion as well as he could and led him slowly forward Chapter 69 It was the dead of night and very dark when Barnaby with his stumbling comrade approached the place where he had left his father but he could see him stealing away into the gloom distrustful even of him and rapidly retreating After calling to him twice or thrice that there was nothing to fear but without effect he suffered Hugh to sink upon the ground and followed to bring him back He continued to creep away until Barnaby was close upon him then turned and said in a terrible though suppressed voice Let me go Do not lay hands upon me You have told her and you and she together have betrayed me Barnaby looked at him in silence You have seen your mother No cried Barnaby eagerly Not for a long time longer than I can tell A whole year I think Is she here His father looked upon him steadfastly for a few moments and then said drawing nearer to him as he spoke for seeing his face and hearing his words it was impossible to doubt his truth What man is that Hugh Hugh Only Hugh You know him HE will not harm you Why you re afraid of Hugh Ha ha ha Afraid of gruff old noisy Hugh What man is he I ask you he rejoined so fiercely that Barnaby stopped in his laugh and shrinking back surveyed him with a look of terrified amazement Why how stern you are You make me fear you though you are my father Why do you speak to me so I want he answered putting away the hand which his son with a timid desire to propitiate him laid upon his sleeve I want an answer and you give me only jeers and questions Who have you brought with you to this hiding place poor fool and where is the blind man I don t know where His house was close shut I waited but no person came that was no fault of mine This is Hugh brave Hugh who broke into that ugly jail and set us free Aha You like him now do you You like him now Why does he lie upon the ground He has had a fall and has been drinking The fields and trees go round and round and round with him and the ground heaves under his feet You know him You remember See They had by this time returned to where he lay and both stooped over him to look into his face I recollect the man his father murmured Why did you bring him here Because he would have been killed if I had left him over yonder They were firing guns and shedding blood Does the sight of blood turn you sick father I see it does by your face That s like me What are you looking at At nothing said the murderer softly as he started back a pace or two and gazed with sunken jaw and staring eyes above his son s head At nothing He remained in the same attitude and with the same expression on his face for a minute or more then glanced slowly round as if he had lost something and went shivering back towards the shed Shall I bring him in father asked Barnaby who had looked on wondering He only answered with a suppressed groan and lying down upon the ground wrapped his cloak about his head and shrunk into the darkest corner Finding that nothing would rouse Hugh now or make him sensible for a moment Barnaby dragged him along the grass and laid him on a little heap of refuse hay and straw which had been his own bed first having brought some water from a running stream hard by and washed his wound and laved his hands and face Then he lay down himself between the two to pass the night and looking at the stars fell fast asleep Awakened early in the morning by the sunshine and the songs of birds and hum of insects he left them sleeping in the hut and walked into the sweet and pleasant air But he felt that on his jaded senses oppressed and burdened with the dreadful scenes of last night and many nights before all the beauties of opening day which he had so often tasted and in which he had had such deep delight fell heavily He thought of the blithe mornings when he and the dogs went bounding on together through the woods and fields and the recollection filled his eyes with tears He had no consciousness God help him of having done wrong nor had he any new perception of the merits of the cause in which he had been engaged or those of the men who advocated it but he was full of cares now and regrets and dismal recollections and wishes quite unknown to him before that this or that event had never happened and that the sorrow and suffering of so many people had been spared And now he began to think how happy they would be his father mother he and Hugh if they rambled away together and lived in some lonely place where there were none of these troubles and that perhaps the blind man who had talked so wisely about gold and told him of the great secrets he knew could teach them how to live without being pinched by want As this occurred to him he was the more sorry that he had not seen him last night and he was still brooding over this regret when his father came and touched him on the shoulder Ah cried Barnaby starting from his fit of thoughtfulness Is it only you Who should it be I almost thought he answered it was the blind man I must have some talk with him father And so must I for without seeing him I don t know where to fly or what to do and lingering here is death You must go to him again and bring him here Must I cried Barnaby delighted that s brave father That s what I want to do But you must bring only him and none other And though you wait at his door a whole day and night still you must wait and not come back without him Don t you fear that he cried gaily He shall come he shall come Trim off these gewgaws said his father plucking the scraps of ribbon and the feathers from his hat and over your own dress wear my cloak Take heed how you go and they will be too busy in the streets to notice you Of your coming back you need take no account for he ll manage that safely To be sure said Barnaby To be sure he will A wise man father and one who can teach us to be rich Oh I know him I know him He was speedily dressed and as well disguised as he could be With a lighter heart he then set off upon his second journey leaving Hugh who was still in a drunken stupor stretched upon the ground within the shed and his father walking to and fro before it The murderer full of anxious thoughts looked after him and paced up and down disquieted by every breath of air that whispered among the boughs and by every light shadow thrown by the passing clouds upon the daisied ground He was anxious for his safe return and yet though his own life and safety hung upon it felt a relief while he was gone In the intense selfishness which the constant presence before him of his great crimes and their consequences here and hereafter engendered every thought of Barnaby as his son was swallowed up and lost Still his presence was a torture and reproach in his wild eyes there were terrible images of that guilty night with his unearthly aspect and his half formed mind he seemed to the murderer a creature who had sprung into existence from his victim s blood He could not bear his look his voice his touch and yet he was forced by his own desperate condition and his only hope of cheating the gibbet to have him by his side and to know that he was inseparable from his single chance of escape He walked to and fro with little rest all day revolving these things in his mind and still Hugh lay unconscious in the shed At length when the sun was setting Barnaby returned leading the blind man and talking earnestly to him as they came along together The murderer advanced to meet them and bidding his son go on and speak to Hugh who had just then staggered to his feet took his place at the blind man s elbow and slowly followed towards the shed Why did you send HIM said Stagg Don t you know it was the way to have him lost as soon as found Would you have had me come myself returned the other Humph Perhaps not I was before the jail on Tuesday night but missed you in the crowd I was out last night too There was good work last night gay work profitable work he added rattling the money in his pockets Have you Seen your good lady Yes Do you mean to tell me more or not I ll tell you all returned the blind man with a laugh Excuse me but I love to see you so impatient There s energy in it Does she consent to say the word that may save me No returned the blind man emphatically as he turned his face towards him No Thus it is She has been at death s door since she lost her darling has been insensible and I know not what I tracked her to a hospital and presented myself with your leave at her bedside Our talk was not a long one for she was weak and there being people near I was not quite easy But I told her all that you and I agreed upon and pointed out the young gentleman s position in strong terms She tried to soften me but that of course as I told her was lost time She cried and moaned you may be sure all women do Then of a sudden she found her voice and strength and said that Heaven would help her and her innocent son and that to Heaven she appealed against us which she did in really very pretty language I assure you I advised her as a friend not to count too much on assistance from any such distant quarter recommended her to think of it told her where I lived said I knew she would send to me before noon next day and left her either in a faint or shamming When he had concluded this narration during which he had made several pauses for the convenience of cracking and eating nuts of which he seemed to have a pocketful the blind man pulled a flask from his pocket took a draught himself and offered it to his companion You won t won t you he said feeling that he pushed it from him Well Then the gallant gentleman who s lodging with you will Hallo bully Death said the other holding him back Will you tell me what I am to do Do Nothing easier Make a moonlight flitting in two hours time with the young gentleman he s quite ready to go I have been giving him good advice as we came along and get as far from London as you can Let me know where you are and leave the rest to me She MUST come round she can t hold out long and as to the chances of your being retaken in the meanwhile why it wasn t one man who got out of Newgate but three hundred Think of that for your comfort We must support life How How repeated the blind man By eating and drinking And how get meat and drink but by paying for it Money he cried slapping his pocket Is money the word Why the streets have been running money Devil send that the sport s not over yet for these are jolly times golden rare roaring scrambling times Hallo bully Hallo Hallo Drink bully drink Where are ye there Hallo With such vociferations and with a boisterous manner which bespoke his perfect abandonment to the general licence and disorder he groped his way towards the shed where Hugh and Barnaby were sitting on the ground Put it about he cried handing his flask to Hugh The kennels run with wine and gold Guineas and strong water flow from the very pumps About with it don t spare it Exhausted unwashed unshorn begrimed with smoke and dust his hair clotted with blood his voice quite gone so that he spoke in whispers his skin parched up by fever his whole body bruised and cut and beaten about Hugh still took the flask and raised it to his lips He was in the act of drinking when the front of the shed was suddenly darkened and Dennis stood before them No offence no offence said that personage in a conciliatory tone as Hugh stopped in his draught and eyed him with no pleasant look from head to foot No offence brother Barnaby here too eh How are you Barnaby And two other gentlemen Your humble servant gentlemen No offence to YOU either I hope Eh brothers Notwithstanding that he spoke in this very friendly and confident manner he seemed to have considerable hesitation about entering and remained outside the roof He was rather better dressed than usual wearing the same suit of threadbare black it is true but having round his neck an unwholesome looking cravat of a yellowish white and on his hands great leather gloves such as a gardener might wear in following his trade His shoes were newly greased and ornamented with a pair of rusty iron buckles the packthread at his knees had been renewed and where he wanted buttons he wore pins Altogether he had something the look of a tipstaff or a bailiff s follower desperately faded but who had a notion of keeping up the appearance of a professional character and making the best of the worst means You re very snug here said Mr Dennis pulling out a mouldy pocket handkerchief which looked like a decomposed halter and wiping his forehead in a nervous manner Not snug enough to prevent your finding us it seems Hugh answered sulkily Why I ll tell you what brother said Dennis with a friendly smile when you don t want me to know which way you re riding you must wear another sort of bells on your horse Ah I know the sound of them you wore last night and have got quick ears for em that s the truth Well but how are you brother He had by this time approached and now ventured to sit down by him How am I answered Hugh Where were you yesterday Where did you go when you left me in the jail Why did you leave me And what did you mean by rolling your eyes and shaking your fist at me eh I shake my fist at you brother said Dennis gently checking Hugh s uplifted hand which looked threatening Your stick then it s all one Lord love you brother I meant nothing You don t understand me by half I shouldn t wonder now he added in the tone of a desponding and an injured man but you thought because I wanted them chaps left in the prison that I was a going to desert the banners Hugh told him with an oath that he had thought so Well said Mr Dennis mournfully if you an t enough to make a man mistrust his feller creeturs I don t know what is Desert the banners Me Ned Dennis as was so christened by his own father Is this axe your n brother Yes it s mine said Hugh in the same sullen manner as before it might have hurt you if you had come in its way once or twice last night Put it down Might have hurt me said Mr Dennis still keeping it in his hand and feeling the edge with an air of abstraction Might have hurt me and me exerting myself all the time to the wery best advantage Here s a world And you re not a going to ask me to take a sup out of that ere bottle eh Hugh passed it towards him As he raised it to his lips Barnaby jumped up and motioning them to be silent looked eagerly out What s the matter Barnaby said Dennis glancing at Hugh and dropping the flask but still holding the axe in his hand Hush he answered softly What do I see glittering behind the hedge What cried the hangman raising his voice to its highest pitch and laying hold of him and Hugh Not SOLDIERS surely That moment the shed was filled with armed men and a body of horse galloping into the field drew up before it There said Dennis who remained untouched among them when they had seized their prisoners it s them two young ones gentlemen that the proclamation puts a price on This other s an escaped felon I m sorry for it brother he added in a tone of resignation addressing himself to Hugh but you ve brought it on yourself you forced me to do it you wouldn t respect the soundest constitootional principles you know you went and wiolated the wery framework of society I had sooner have given away a trifle in charity than done this I would upon my soul If you ll keep fast hold on em gentlemen I think I can make a shift to tie em better than you can But this operation was postponed for a few moments by a new occurrence The blind man whose ears were quicker than most people s sight had been alarmed before Barnaby by a rustling in the bushes under cover of which the soldiers had advanced He retreated instantly had hidden somewhere for a minute and probably in his confusion mistaking the point at which he had emerged was now seen running across the open meadow An officer cried directly that he had helped to plunder a house last night He was loudly called on to surrender He ran the harder and in a few seconds would have been out of gunshot The word was given and the men fired There was a breathless pause and a profound silence during which all eyes were fixed upon him He had been seen to start at the discharge as if the report had frightened him But he neither stopped nor slackened his pace in the least and ran on full forty yards further Then without one reel or stagger or sign of faintness or quivering of any limb he dropped Some of them hurried up to where he lay the hangman with them Everything had passed so quickly that the smoke had not yet scattered but curled slowly off in a little cloud which seemed like the dead man s spirit moving solemnly away There were a few drops of blood upon the grass more when they turned him over that was all Look here Look here said the hangman stooping one knee beside the body and gazing up with a disconsolate face at the officer and men Here s a pretty sight Stand out of the way replied the officer Serjeant see what he had about him The man turned his pockets out upon the grass and counted besides some foreign coins and two rings five and forty guineas in gold These were bundled up in a handkerchief and carried away the body remained there for the present but six men and the serjeant were left to take it to the nearest public house Now then if you re going said the serjeant clapping Dennis on the back and pointing after the officer who was walking towards the shed To which Mr Dennis only replied Don t talk to me and then repeated what he had said before namely Here s a pretty sight It s not one that you care for much I should think observed the serjeant coolly Why who said Mr Dennis rising should care for it if I don t Oh I didn t know you was so tender hearted said the serjeant That s all Tender hearted echoed Dennis Tender hearted Look at this man Do you call THIS constitootional Do you see him shot through and through instead of being worked off like a Briton Damme if I know which party to side with You re as bad as the other What s to become of the country if the military power s to go a superseding the ciwilians in this way Where s this poor feller creetur s rights as a citizen that he didn t have ME in his last moments I was here I was willing I was ready These are nice times brother to have the dead crying out against us in this way and sleep comfortably in our beds arterwards wery nice Whether he derived any material consolation from binding the prisoners is uncertain most probably he did At all events his being summoned to that work diverted him for the time from these painful reflections and gave his thoughts a more congenial occupation They were not all three carried off together but in two parties Barnaby and his father going by one road in the centre of a body of foot and Hugh fast bound upon a horse and strongly guarded by a troop of cavalry being taken by another They had no opportunity for the least communication in the short interval which preceded their departure being kept strictly apart Hugh only observed that Barnaby walked with a drooping head among his guard and without raising his eyes that he tried to wave his fettered hand when he passed For himself he buoyed up his courage as he rode along with the assurance that the mob would force his jail wherever it might be and set him at liberty But when they got into London and more especially into Fleet Market lately the stronghold of the rioters where the military were rooting out the last remnant of the crowd he saw that this hope was gone and felt that he was riding to his death Chapter 70 Mr Dennis having despatched this piece of business without any personal hurt or inconvenience and having now retired into the tranquil respectability of private life resolved to solace himself with half an hour or so of female society With this amiable purpose in his mind he bent his steps towards the house where Dolly and Miss Haredale were still confined and whither Miss Miggs had also been removed by order of Mr Simon Tappertit As he walked along the streets with his leather gloves clasped behind him and his face indicative of cheerful thought and pleasant calculation Mr Dennis might have been likened unto a farmer ruminating among his crops and enjoying by anticipation the bountiful gifts of Providence Look where he would some heap of ruins afforded him rich promise of a working off the whole town appeared to have been ploughed and sown and nurtured by most genial weather and a goodly harvest was at hand Having taken up arms and resorted to deeds of violence with the great main object of preserving the Old Bailey in all its purity and the gallows in all its pristine usefulness and moral grandeur it would perhaps be going too far to assert that Mr Dennis had ever distinctly contemplated and foreseen this happy state of things He rather looked upon it as one of those beautiful dispensations which are inscrutably brought about for the behoof and advantage of good men He felt as it were personally referred to in this prosperous ripening for the gibbet and had never considered himself so much the pet and favourite child of Destiny or loved that lady so well or with such a calm and virtuous reliance in all his life As to being taken up himself for a rioter and punished with the rest Mr Dennis dismissed that possibility from his thoughts as an idle chimera arguing that the line of conduct he had adopted at Newgate and the service he had rendered that day would be more than a set off against any evidence which might identify him as a member of the crowd That any charge of companionship which might be made against him by those who were themselves in danger would certainly go for nought And that if any trivial indiscretion on his part should unluckily come out the uncommon usefulness of his office at present and the great demand for the exercise of its functions would certainly cause it to be winked at and passed over In a word he had played his cards throughout with great care had changed sides at the very nick of time had delivered up two of the most notorious rioters and a distinguished felon to boot and was quite at his ease Saving for there is a reservation and even Mr Dennis was not perfectly happy saving for one circumstance to wit the forcible detention of Dolly and Miss Haredale in a house almost adjoining his own This was a stumbling block for if they were discovered and released they could by the testimony they had it in their power to give place him in a situation of great jeopardy and to set them at liberty first extorting from them an oath of secrecy and silence was a thing not to be thought of It was more perhaps with an eye to the danger which lurked in this quarter than from his abstract love of conversation with the sex that the hangman quickening his steps now hastened into their society cursing the amorous natures of Hugh and Mr Tappertit with great heartiness at every step he took When be entered the miserable room in which they were confined Dolly and Miss Haredale withdrew in silence to the remotest corner But Miss Miggs who was particularly tender of her reputation immediately fell upon her knees and began to scream very loud crying What will become of me Where is my Simmuns Have mercy good gentlemen on my sex s weaknesses with other doleful lamentations of that nature which she delivered with great propriety and decorum Miss miss whispered Dennis beckoning to her with his forefinger come here I won t hurt you Come here my lamb will you On hearing this tender epithet Miss Miggs who had left off screaming when he opened his lips and had listened to him attentively began again crying Oh I m his lamb He says I m his lamb Oh gracious why wasn t I born old and ugly Why was I ever made to be the youngest of six and all of em dead and in their blessed graves excepting one married sister which is settled in Golden Lion Court number twenty sivin second bell handle on the Don t I say I an t a going to hurt you said Dennis pointing to a chair Why miss what s the matter I don t know what mayn t be the matter cried Miss Miggs clasping her hands distractedly Anything may be the matter But nothing is I tell you said the hangman First stop that noise and come and sit down here will you chuckey The coaxing tone in which he said these latter words might have failed in its object if he had not accompanied them with sundry sharp jerks of his thumb over one shoulder and with divers winks and thrustings of his tongue into his cheek from which signals the damsel gathered that he sought to speak to her apart concerning Miss Haredale and Dolly Her curiosity being very powerful and her jealousy by no means inactive she arose and with a great deal of shivering and starting back and much muscular action among all the small bones in her throat gradually approached him Sit down said the hangman Suiting the action to the word he thrust her rather suddenly and prematurely into a chair and designing to reassure her by a little harmless jocularity such as is adapted to please and fascinate the sex converted his right forefinger into an ideal bradawl or gimlet and made as though he would screw the same into her side whereat Miss Miggs shrieked again and evinced symptoms of faintness Lovey my dear whispered Dennis drawing his chair close to hers When was your young man here last eh MY young man good gentleman answered Miggs in a tone of exquisite distress Ah Simmuns you know him said Dennis Mine indeed cried Miggs with a burst of bitterness and as she said it she glanced towards Dolly MINE good gentleman This was just what Mr Dennis wanted and expected Ah he said looking so soothingly not to say amorously on Miggs that she sat as she afterwards remarked on pins and needles of the sharpest Whitechapel kind not knowing what intentions might be suggesting that expression to his features I was afraid of that I saw as much myself It s her fault She WILL entice em I wouldn t cried Miggs folding her hands and looking upwards with a kind of devout blankness I wouldn t lay myself out as she does I wouldn t be as bold as her I wouldn t seem to say to all male creeturs Come and kiss me and here a shudder quite convulsed her frame for any earthly crowns as might be offered Worlds Miggs added solemnly should not reduce me No Not if I was Wenis Well but you ARE Wenus you know said Mr Dennis confidentially No I am not good gentleman answered Miggs shaking her head with an air of self denial which seemed to imply that she might be if she chose but she hoped she knew better No I am not good gentleman Don t charge me with it Up to this time she had turned round every now and then to where Dolly and Miss Haredale had retired and uttered a scream or groan or laid her hand upon her heart and trembled excessively with a view of keeping up appearances and giving them to understand that she conversed with the visitor under protest and on compulsion and at a great personal sacrifice for their common good But at this point Mr Dennis looked so very full of meaning and gave such a singularly expressive twitch to his face as a request to her to come still nearer to him that she abandoned these little arts and gave him her whole and undivided attention When was Simmuns here I say quoth Dennis in her ear Not since yesterday morning and then only for a few minutes Not all day the day before You know he meant all along to carry off that one said Dennis indicating Dolly by the slightest possible jerk of his head And to hand you over to somebody else Miss Miggs who had fallen into a terrible state of grief when the first part of this sentence was spoken recovered a little at the second and seemed by the sudden check she put upon her tears to intimate that possibly this arrangement might meet her views and that it might perhaps remain an open question But unfort nately pursued Dennis who observed this somebody else was fond of her too you see and even if he wasn t somebody else is took for a rioter and it s all over with him Miss Miggs relapsed Now I want said Dennis to clear this house and to see you righted What if I was to get her off out of the way eh Miss Miggs brightening again rejoined with many breaks and pauses from excess of feeling that temptations had been Simmuns s bane That it was not his faults but hers meaning Dolly s That men did not see through these dreadful arts as women did and therefore was caged and trapped as Simmun had been That she had no personal motives to serve far from it on the contrary her intentions was good towards all parties But forasmuch as she knowed that Simmun if united to any designing and artful minxes she would name no names for that was not her dispositions to ANY designing and artful minxes must be made miserable and unhappy for life she DID incline towards prewentions Such she added was her free confessions But as this was private feelings and might perhaps be looked upon as wengeance she begged the gentleman would say no more Whatever he said wishing to do her duty by all mankind even by them as had ever been her bitterest enemies she would not listen to him With that she stopped her ears and shook her head from side to side to intimate to Mr Dennis that though he talked until he had no breath left she was as deaf as any adder Lookee here my sugar stick said Mr Dennis if your view s the same as mine and you ll only be quiet and slip away at the right time I can have the house clear to morrow and be out of this trouble Stop though there s the other Which other sir asked Miggs still with her fingers in her ears and her head shaking obstinately Why the tallest one yonder said Dennis as he stroked his chin and added in an undertone to himself something about not crossing Muster Gashford Miss Miggs replied still being profoundly deaf that if Miss Haredale stood in the way at all he might make himself quite easy on that score as she had gathered from what passed between Hugh and Mr Tappertit when they were last there that she was to be removed alone not by them but by somebody else to morrow night Mr Dennis opened his eyes very wide at this piece of information whistled once considered once and finally slapped his head once and nodded once as if he had got the clue to this mysterious removal and so dismissed it Then he imparted his design concerning Dolly to Miss Miggs who was taken more deaf than before when he began and so remained all through The notable scheme was this Mr Dennis was immediately to seek out from among the rioters some daring young fellow and he had one in his eye he said who terrified by the threats he could hold out to him and alarmed by the capture of so many who were no better and no worse than he would gladly avail himself of any help to get abroad and out of harm s way with his plunder even though his journey were incumbered by an unwilling companion indeed the unwilling companion being a beautiful girl would probably be an additional inducement and temptation Such a person found he proposed to bring him there on the ensuing night when the tall one was taken off and Miss Miggs had purposely retired and then that Dolly should be gagged muffled in a cloak and carried in any handy conveyance down to the river s side where there were abundant means of getting her smuggled snugly off in any small craft of doubtful character and no questions asked With regard to the expense of this removal he would say at a rough calculation that two or three silver tea or coffee pots with something additional for drink such as a muffineer or toast rack would more than cover it Articles of plate of every kind having been buried by the rioters in several lonely parts of London and particularly as he knew in St James s Square which though easy of access was little frequented after dark and had a convenient piece of water in the midst the needful funds were close at hand and could be had upon the shortest notice With regard to Dolly the gentleman would exercise his own discretion He would be bound to do nothing but to take her away and keep her away All other arrangements and dispositions would rest entirely with himself If Miss Miggs had had her hearing no doubt she would have been greatly shocked by the indelicacy of a young female s going away with a stranger by night for her moral feelings as we have said were of the tenderest kind but directly Mr Dennis ceased to speak she reminded him that he had only wasted breath She then went on to say still with her fingers in her ears that nothing less than a severe practical lesson would save the locksmith s daughter from utter ruin and that she felt it as it were a moral obligation and a sacred duty to the family to wish that some one would devise one for her reformation Miss Miggs remarked and very justly as an abstract sentiment which happened to occur to her at the moment that she dared to say the locksmith and his wife would murmur and repine if they were ever by forcible abduction or otherwise to lose their child but that we seldom knew in this world what was best for us such being our sinful and imperfect natures that very few arrived at that clear understanding Having brought their conversation to this satisfactory end they parted Dennis to pursue his design and take another walk about his farm Miss Miggs to launch when he left her into such a burst of mental anguish which she gave them to understand was occasioned by certain tender things he had had the presumption and audacity to say that little Dolly s heart was quite melted Indeed she said and did so much to soothe the outraged feelings of Miss Miggs and looked so beautiful while doing so that if that young maid had not had ample vent for her surpassing spite in a knowledge of the mischief that was brewing she must have scratched her features on the spot Chapter 71 All next day Emma Haredale Dolly and Miggs remained cooped up together in what had now been their prison for so many days without seeing any person or hearing any sound but the murmured conversation in an outer room of the men who kept watch over them There appeared to be more of these fellows than there had been hitherto and they could no longer hear the voices of women which they had before plainly distinguished Some new excitement too seemed to prevail among them for there was much stealthy going in and out and a constant questioning of those who were newly arrived They had previously been quite reckless in their behaviour often making a great uproar quarrelling among themselves fighting dancing and singing They were now very subdued and silent conversing almost in whispers and stealing in and out with a soft and stealthy tread very different from the boisterous trampling in which their arrivals and departures had hitherto been announced to the trembling captives Whether this change was occasioned by the presence among them of some person of authority in their ranks or by any other cause they were unable to decide Sometimes they thought it was in part attributable to there being a sick man in the chamber for last night there had been a shuffling of feet as though a burden were brought in and afterwards a moaning noise But they had no means of ascertaining the truth for any question or entreaty on their parts only provoked a storm of execrations or something worse and they were too happy to be left alone unassailed by threats or admiration to risk even that comfort by any voluntary communication with those who held them in durance It was sufficiently evident both to Emma and to the locksmith s poor little daughter herself that she Dolly was the great object of attraction and that so soon as they should have leisure to indulge in the softer passion Hugh and Mr Tappertit would certainly fall to blows for her sake in which latter case it was not very difficult to see whose prize she would become With all her old horror of that man revived and deepened into a degree of aversion and abhorrence which no language can describe with a thousand old recollections and regrets and causes of distress anxiety and fear besetting her on all sides poor Dolly Varden sweet blooming buxom Dolly began to hang her head and fade and droop like a beautiful flower The colour fled from her cheeks her courage forsook her her gentle heart failed Unmindful of all her provoking caprices forgetful of all her conquests and inconstancy with all her winning little vanities quite gone she nestled all the livelong day in Emma Haredale s bosom and sometimes calling on her dear old grey haired father sometimes on her mother and sometimes even on her old home pined slowly away like a poor bird in its cage Light hearts light hearts that float so gaily on a smooth stream that are so sparkling and buoyant in the sunshine down upon fruit bloom upon flowers blush in summer air life of the winged insect whose whole existence is a day how soon ye sink in troubled water Poor Dolly s heart a little gentle idle fickle thing giddy restless fluttering constant to nothing but bright looks and smiles and laughter Dolly s heart was breaking Emma had known grief and could bear it better She had little comfort to impart but she could soothe and tend her and she did so and Dolly clung to her like a child to its nurse In endeavouring to inspire her with some fortitude she increased her own and though the nights were long and the days dismal and she felt the wasting influence of watching and fatigue and had perhaps a more defined and clear perception of their destitute condition and its worst dangers she uttered no complaint Before the ruffians in whose power they were she bore herself so calmly and with such an appearance in the midst of all her terror of a secret conviction that they dared not harm her that there was not a man among them but held her in some degree of dread and more than one believed she had a weapon hidden in her dress and was prepared to use it Such was their condition when they were joined by Miss Miggs who gave them to understand that she too had been taken prisoner because of her charms and detailed such feats of resistance she had performed her virtue having given her supernatural strength that they felt it quite a happiness to have her for a champion Nor was this the only comfort they derived at first from Miggs s presence and society for that young lady displayed such resignation and long suffering and so much meek endurance under her trials and breathed in all her chaste discourse a spirit of such holy confidence and resignation and devout belief that all would happen for the best that Emma felt her courage strengthened by the bright example never doubting but that everything she said was true and that she like them was torn from all she loved and agonised by doubt and apprehension As to poor Dolly she was roused at first by seeing one who came from home but when she heard under what circumstances she had left it and into whose hands her father had fallen she wept more bitterly than ever and refused all comfort Miss Miggs was at some trouble to reprove her for this state of mind and to entreat her to take example by herself who she said was now receiving back with interest tenfold the amount of her subscriptions to the red brick dwelling house in the articles of peace of mind and a quiet conscience And while on serious topics Miss Miggs considered it her duty to try her hand at the conversion of Miss Haredale for whose improvement she launched into a polemical address of some length in the course whereof she likened herself unto a chosen missionary and that young lady to a cannibal in darkness Indeed she returned so often to these sublects and so frequently called upon them to take a lesson from her at the same time vaunting and as it were rioting in her huge unworthiness and abundant excess of sin that in the course of a short time she became in that small chamber rather a nuisance than a comfort and rendered them if possible even more unhappy than they had been before The night had now come and for the first time for their jailers had been regular in bringing food and candles they were left in darkness Any change in their condition in such a place inspired new fears and when some hours had passed and the gloom was still unbroken Emma could no longer repress her alarm They listened attentively There was the same murmuring in the outer room and now and then a moan which seemed to be wrung from a person in great pain who made an effort to subdue it but could not Even these men seemed to be in darkness too for no light shone through the chinks in the door nor were they moving as their custom was but quite still the silence being unbroken by so much as the creaking of a board At first Miss Miggs wondered greatly in her own mind who this sick person might be but arriving on second thoughts at the conclusion that he was a part of the schemes on foot and an artful device soon to be employed with great success she opined for Miss Haredale s comfort that it must be some misguided Papist who had been wounded and this happy supposition encouraged her to say under her breath Ally Looyer several times Is it possible said Emma with some indignation that you who have seen these men committing the outrages you have told us of and who have fallen into their hands like us can exult in their cruelties Personal considerations miss rejoined Miggs sinks into nothing afore a noble cause Ally Looyer Ally Looyer Ally Looyer good gentlemen It seemed from the shrill pertinacity with which Miss Miggs repeated this form of acclamation that she was calling the same through the keyhole of the door but in the profound darkness she could not be seen If the time has come Heaven knows it may come at any moment when they are bent on prosecuting the designs whatever they may be with which they have brought us here can you still encourage and take part with them demanded Emma I thank my goodness gracious blessed stars I can miss returned Miggs with increased energy Ally Looyer good gentlemen Even Dolly cast down and disappointed as she was revived at this and bade Miggs hold her tongue directly WHICH was you pleased to observe Miss Varden said Miggs with a strong emphasis on the irrelative pronoun Dolly repeated her request Ho gracious me cried Miggs with hysterical derision Ho gracious me Yes to be sure I will Ho yes I am a abject slave and a toiling moiling constant working always being found fault with never giving satisfactions nor having no time to clean oneself potter s wessel an t I miss Ho yes My situations is lowly and my capacities is limited and my duties is to humble myself afore the base degenerating daughters of their blessed mothers as is fit to keep companies with holy saints but is born to persecutions from wicked relations and to demean myself before them as is no better than Infidels an t it miss Ho yes My only becoming occupations is to help young flaunting pagins to brush and comb and titiwate theirselves into whitening and suppulchres and leave the young men to think that there an t a bit of padding in it nor no pinching ins nor fillings out nor pomatums nor deceits nor earthly wanities an t it miss Yes to be sure it is ho yes Having delivered these ironical passages with a most wonderful volubility and with a shrillness perfectly deafening especially when she jerked out the interjections Miss Miggs from mere habit and not because weeping was at all appropriate to the occasion which was one of triumph concluded by bursting into a flood of tears and calling in an impassioned manner on the name of Simmuns What Emma Haredale and Dolly would have done or how long Miss Miggs now that she had hoisted her true colours would have gone on waving them before their astonished senses it is impossible to tell Nor is it necessary to speculate on these matters for a startling interruption occurred at that moment which took their whole attention by storm This was a violent knocking at the door of the house and then its sudden bursting open which was immediately succeeded by a scuffle in the room without and the clash of weapons Transported with the hope that rescue had at length arrived Emma and Dolly shrieked aloud for help nor were their shrieks unanswered for after a hurried interval a man bearing in one hand a drawn sword and in the other a taper rushed into the chamber where they were confined It was some check upon their transport to find in this person an entire stranger but they appealed to him nevertheless and besought him in impassioned language to restore them to their friends For what other purpose am I here he answered closing the door and standing with his back against it With what object have I made my way to this place through difficulty and danger but to preserve you With a joy for which it was impossible to find adequate expression they embraced each other and thanked Heaven for this most timely aid Their deliverer stepped forward for a moment to put the light upon the table and immediately returning to his former position against the door bared his head and looked on smilingly You have news of my uncle sir said Emma turning hastily towards him And of my father and mother added Dolly Yes he said Good news They are alive and unhurt they both cried at once Yes and unhurt he rejoined And close at hand I did not say close at hand he answered smoothly they are at no great distance YOUR friends sweet one he added addressing Dolly are within a few hours journey You will be restored to them I hope to night My uncle sir faltered Emma Your uncle dear Miss Haredale happily I say happily because he has succeeded where many of our creed have failed and is safe has crossed the sea and is out of Britain I thank God for it said Emma faintly You say well You have reason to be thankful greater reason than it is possible for you who have seen but one night of these cruel outrages to imagine Does he desire said Emma that I should follow him Do you ask if he desires it cried the stranger in surprise IF he desires it But you do not know the danger of remaining in England the difficulty of escape or the price hundreds would pay to secure the means when you make that inquiry Pardon me I had forgotten that you could not being prisoner here I gather sir said Emma after a moment s pause from what you hint at but fear to tell me that I have witnessed but the beginning and the least of the violence to which we are exposed and that it has not yet slackened in its fury He shrugged his shoulders shook his head lifted up his hands and with the same smooth smile which was not a pleasant one to see cast his eyes upon the ground and remained silent You may venture sir to speak plain said Emma and to tell me the worst We have undergone some preparation for it But here Dolly interposed and entreated her not to hear the worst but the best and besought the gentleman to tell them the best and to keep the remainder of his news until they were safe among their friends again It is told in three words he said glancing at the locksmith s daughter with a look of some displeasure The people have risen to a man against us the streets are filled with soldiers who support them and do their bidding We have no protection but from above and no safety but in flight and that is a poor resource for we are watched on every hand and detained here both by force and fraud Miss Haredale I cannot bear believe me that I cannot bear by speaking of myself or what I have done or am prepared to do to seem to vaunt my services before you But having powerful Protestant connections and having my whole wealth embarked with theirs in shipping and commerce I happily possessed the means of saving your uncle I have the means of saving you and in redemption of my sacred promise made to him I am here pledged not to leave you until I have placed you in his arms The treachery or penitence of one of the men about you led to the discovery of your place of confinement and that I have forced my way here sword in hand you see You bring said Emma faltering some note or token from my uncle No he doesn t cried Dolly pointing at him earnestly now I am sure he doesn t Don t go with him for the world Hush pretty fool be silent he replied frowning angrily upon her No Miss Haredale I have no letter nor any token of any kind for while I sympathise with you and such as you on whom misfortune so heavy and so undeserved has fallen I value my life I carry therefore no writing which found upon me would lead to its certain loss I never thought of bringing any other token nor did Mr Haredale think of entrusting me with one possibly because he had good experience of my faith and honesty and owed his life to me There was a reproof conveyed in these words which to a nature like Emma Haredale s was well addressed But Dolly who was differently constituted was by no means touched by it and still conjured her in all the terms of affection and attachment she could think of not to be lured away Time presses said their visitor who although he sought to express the deepest interest had something cold and even in his speech that grated on the ear and danger surrounds us If I have exposed myself to it in vain let it be so but if you and he should ever meet again do me justice If you decide to remain as I think you do remember Miss Haredale that I left you with a solemn caution and acquitting myself of all the consequences to which you expose yourself Stay sir cried Emma one moment I beg you Cannot we and she drew Dolly closer to her cannot we go together The task of conveying one female in safety through such scenes as we must encounter to say nothing of attracting the attention of those who crowd the streets he answered is enough I have said that she will be restored to her friends to night If you accept the service I tender Miss Haredale she shall be instantly placed in safe conduct and that promise redeemed Do you decide to remain People of all ranks and creeds are flying from the town which is sacked from end to end Let me be of use in some quarter Do you stay or go Dolly said Emma in a hurried manner my dear girl this is our last hope If we part now it is only that we may meet again in happiness and honour I will trust to this gentleman No no no cried Dolly clinging to her Pray pray do not You hear said Emma that to night only to night within a few hours think of that you will be among those who would die of grief to lose you and who are now plunged in the deepest misery for your sake Pray for me dear girl as I will for you and never forget the many quiet hours we have passed together Say one God bless you Say that at parting But Dolly could say nothing no not when Emma kissed her cheek a hundred times and covered it with tears could she do more than hang upon her neck and sob and clasp and hold her tight We have time for no more of this cried the man unclenching her hands and pushing her roughly off as he drew Emma Haredale towards the door Now Quick outside there are you ready Ay cried a loud voice which made him start Quite ready Stand back here for your lives And in an instant he was felled like an ox in the butcher s shambles struck down as though a block of marble had fallen from the roof and crushed him and cheerful light and beaming faces came pouring in and Emma was clasped in her uncle s embrace and Dolly with a shriek that pierced the air fell into the arms of her father and mother What fainting there was what laughing what crying what sobbing what smiling how much questioning no answering all talking together all beside themselves with joy what kissing congratulating embracing shaking of hands and falling into all these raptures over and over and over again no language can describe At length and after a long time the old locksmith went up and fairly hugged two strangers who had stood apart and left them to themselves and then they saw whom Yes Edward Chester and Joseph Willet See here cried the locksmith See here where would any of us have been without these two Oh Mr Edward Mr Edward oh Joe Joe how light and yet how full you have made my old heart to night It was Mr Edward that knocked him down sir said Joe I longed to do it but I gave it up to him Come you brave and honest gentleman Get your senses together for you haven t long to lie here He had his foot upon the breast of their sham deliverer in the absence of a spare arm and gave him a gentle roll as he spoke Gashford for it was no other crouching yet malignant raised his scowling face like sin subdued and pleaded to be gently used I have access to all my lord s papers Mr Haredale he said in a submissive voice Mr Haredale keeping his back towards him and not once looking round there are very important documents among them There are a great many in secret drawers and distributed in various places known only to my lord and me I can give some very valuable information and render important assistance to any inquiry You will have to answer it if I receive ill usage Pah cried Joe in deep disgust Get up man you re waited for outside Get up do you hear Gashford slowly rose and picking up his hat and looking with a baffled malevolence yet with an air of despicable humility all round the room crawled out And now gentlemen said Joe who seemed to be the spokesman of the party for all the rest were silent the sooner we get back to the Black Lion the better perhaps Mr Haredale nodded assent and drawing his niece s arm through his and taking one of her hands between his own passed out straightway followed by the locksmith Mrs Varden and Dolly who would scarcely have presented a sufficient surface for all the hugs and caresses they bestowed upon her though she had been a dozen Dollys Edward Chester and Joe followed And did Dolly never once look behind not once Was there not one little fleeting glimpse of the dark eyelash almost resting on her flushed cheek and of the downcast sparkling eye it shaded Joe thought there was and he is not likely to have been mistaken for there were not many eyes li
